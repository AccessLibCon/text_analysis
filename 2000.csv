2000,2000-09-21,9:30 - 10:15,"Victoria Marshall (Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NF)",Gender & Technology,"Binary distinctions have traditionally been used in discussions of the relationship between gender and technology. Theories have run the gamut from essentialist (""women can't do science""), to biological (""women can't think science""), to psychological (""women won't do science""). Recent research in work and educational settings suggests that the binary distinctions between male and female, masculine and feminine, and Technology and not-Technology are the result of cultural images which have become fixed in the popular imagination. This session will tackle the relationship between our gendered technoculture and the relationships between information professionals, information products, and the populations we serve.",talk,,,,

2000,2000-09-21,2:15 - 3:00,William Oldfield (University of Waterloo),IMS: A Librarian Task in the Instructional Management System,"Since having entered the Learning a Living era, as described by Marshall McLuhan, more and more technological solutions are being developed to facilitate the learning process. But the creation of quality learnware is an enormously expensive process. Quality learnware incorporates the latest research in learning. Promotion of the sharing of these expensive resources is the core of the IMS project. Resource discovery (you have to find something if you want to use it) is the first step. This is cataloguing in library parlance. But IMS goes far beyond resource discovery to interoperability so different learning programs can share the same learnware packages. Different learners have different approaches to learning. Different teachers use different pedagogical approaches to teaching and some may wish to use only subsets of a learnware package or modify it to better fit their local environment. These are some of the challenges facing the IMS project. The presentation will introduce IMS, discuss various challenges facing the project and demonstrate an example of quality learnware.",talk,,,,
2000,2000-09-21,3:30 - 4:15,Terry Noreault (OCLC),OCLC Name Services,"There has been substantial and long term interest in creating a form of URI that is not dependent on physical location. This talk will review the history the efforts on standard names for digital objects (e.g. URN, handles, PURLs, and DOI) and current thinking about how URL is changing into a logical naming system. OCLC has recently been rethinking the PURL system to include a layer of services built on existing standard names. This approach has multiple advantages: 1) does not require new protocol deployment, 2) can be gracefully integrated into existing non-digital naming schemes, and 3) provides a strong foundation for peer level services.",talk,,,,

Today when you search Alta Vista the results could come from the Alta Vista database, the Real Names database, or the Open Directory. Is that the same Open Directory my results come from if I run a search in Lycos? So if I am searching the same database, why are my results different? Today if you run a search in an Internet directory and no results are found within that directory, your search strategy is forwarded to a search engine. But what can I expect from these results? Is link analysis going to conquer relevancy ranking as a method of ranking search results? Come and find out the answer to these mysteries and others.",talk,,,,

The SiteSearch suite of programs in the library is the core of the system with the library providing the majority of the programming support. However a campus wide group is having significant input into the shape of the project and some of the programming.
