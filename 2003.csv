A final report on the initiative, due out this fall, will include a �road map� describing the dimensions of the �e-resource management problem,� a statement of functional requirements, lists of data elements and definitions, supporting flowcharts, and an XML schema � some of which are currently available in draft for discussion purposes. This session will provide an overview and status report on the initiative, a discussion of prospects for standards, and some reflections on the University of Washington�s practical experience as a partner with Innovative Interfaces in the development and local implementation of III�s Electronic Resource Management module.",talk,,https://web.archive.org/web/20180606224217/http://access2003.lib.sfu.ca/presentations/jewell/jewell.ppt,,
2003,2003-10-02,11:00 - 11:45,Kent Weaver (University of Toronto),TSpace: DSpace Implementation at the University of Toronto,"
TSpace is the U of T implementation of DSpace, an open source institutional repository (IR) developed by MIT and Hewlett-Packard. In response to emerging electronic publishing concerns, intellectual property, knowledge and server/storage management, organizations increasingly need ""one place"" to find, store and preserve works that are born digitally. Among IR products, DSpace uniquely marries easy distributed user submissions, a breadth of file formats and digital preservation as an explicit objective. As part of the DSpace Federation, U of T is one of six early adopters. The Federation is not only developing openly available code but also documenting implementation issues such as collection parameters, marketing, training, user support and copyright etc. This session will provide a technical overview, a description of current and potential partnerships and describe the deployment of our early adopter program.",talk,,https://web.archive.org/web/20180606224219/http://access2003.lib.sfu.ca/presentations/weaver/weaver.ppt,,

The session will describe the ASIN Resource Discovery and Management Service (ARDMS), a software solution for integrating all of the above resources into a seamless whole.

For over 17 years Slavko Manojlovich has been the Assistant to the University Librarian for Systems and Planning at Memorial University Of Newfoundland where he has survived(he hopes) the transition from punch card, to microfiche, to mainframe, to client/server, and finally to integrating resource discovery and management solutions. Slavko is a founding member of the Z39.50 Bath Profile Group and served on NISO's Z39.50 US Profile committee. He is currently involved in a number of projects including the Newfoundland Newspaper Index and the Atlantic Scholarly Information Network�s Resource Discovery and Management Service (ARDMS).

2003,2003-10-02,1:30 - 2:15,"Brian Lamb (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC)",Not Quite a Learning Objects Presentation: centralized vs. distributed  approaches,"Recent years have seen convergence in learning object metadata standards, and an increasingly broad commitment to the creation and management of educational multimedia. But discontent with the prevailing vision is building, and dialogue is becoming more contentious as a broader cross-section of the teaching and learning community demand a voice in the process of building standards. Meanwhile, alternative approaches driven by simple tools such as weblogs and wikis are emerging and gaining popularity. The potential benefits of personal publishing tools and RSS in the institution in general, and to the academic library in particular, will be discussed.

In an effort to engage in a dialogue about regional sustainability, a suite of tools has been developed to assist a broad constituency of participants to engage in this discussion both spatially and temporally. These include an interactive software tool, QUEST(TM), to develop and explore desirable futures for the Georgia Basin; an interactive web-based knowledge environment application, GBExplorer, to explore concepts and perspectives about sustainability, browse and create local and expert knowledge represented through maps, narrative, images, audio, video; and action-based resources to assist interested groups to mobilize and determine actions that might contribute to their desired future.

This presentation will review prior digital library applications and identify the strengths of merging digital library technologies, spatial information technologies and participatory processes to create an application, GBExplorer. GBExplorer represents an integrated approach to creating and sharing local and expert knowledge useful to communities. In addition, an overview of the three-tier system architecture will be presented. Technical challenges in building necessary functionality in support of community priorities will be addressed. A tenet of GBExplorer is to connect people with ideas and ideas with place.

2003,2003-10-02,3:30 - 4:15,"David McKnight (McGill University, Montreal)",DPI: The Digital Preservation Imperative - What You Need To Know,"As research libraries acquire and create digital content, Digital Preservation and Asset Management comes to the forefront as one of the most important professional issues that library professionals must face. In essence, each institution must have in place policies and practices which will insure that digital assets are refreshed, migrated and preserved to insure long term access. This is the Digital Preservation Imperative. For the sake of this paper, the author will outline the issues, standards, costs, policies and practices associated with Digital Preservation. The author concludes that research libraries must act responsibly to insure that the digital content they acquire or create today is preserved for future access.

2003,2003-10-03,9:45 - 10:30,David Kisly (University of Windsor),OpenILL: Open Source Interlibrary Loan Management System,"The discussion will describe the evolution of the OpenILL project. Envisioned by the University of Winnipeg as a low-cost alternative to more expensive, proprietary inter-library loan (ILL) management systems, OpenILL is being developed to communicate / inter-operate with other systems, most noteably, GODOT and an LDAP version of the National Library of Canada's Directory of Library Symbols (itself under development).

Starting from the initial rationale for the project, the session will address also the underlying environment (Cold Fusion, Java, MySQL, Fusebox methodology), future developments and the benefits and risks faced by prospective partner libraries.

2003,2003-10-03,11:00 - 11:45,Roy Tennant (California Digital Library),A Metadata Infrastructure for the 21st Century,"MARC and AACR (1 and 2) have sustained us for longer than anyone could have hoped. Although we have tinkered with them for decades, they are now showing their age more than ever. Now with multiple metadata standards that we should be conversant with (e.g., ONIX, DC), and with an encoding (i.e., XML) and manipulation (i.e., XSLT) infrastructure widely available, it seems like an opportune time to revisit our foundational standards. What are the challenges that a 21st Century metadata infrastructure should be able to meet? What are the opportunities before us? What foundation do we need to build to support the collections and services of the 21st century library? These and related issues will be explored in a session that will hopefully leave no sacred cow ungored, and no assumption unchallenged.

If implemented widely, it has the potential to replace IP address validation as the primary means of authenticating library users for remote database access. In this session, two implementors will discuss their experiences with Shibboleth.

Shibboleth at CISTI: Introducing, prototyping and extending
Authors: Glen Newton [presenter] (Head research, Canada Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (CISTI), National Research Council (NRC), David Dearman (Dalhousie University) Carolyn Brown (Manager, Journals Program NRC Research Press, CISTI, NRC)
As both a publisher and consumer of electronic resources, the Shibboleth project is of great interest to CISTI. An overview of Shibboleth's structure and functionality will be given, along with a discussion of the recent work done at CISTI implementing the NRC Research Press prototype. The process of implementing the prototype not only brought CISTI's Research group deeper into the Shibboleth project but resulted in CISTI producing and contributing code which has become part of Shibboleth's code base.

Implementing Shibboleth: A Content Provider's Perspective
EBSCO Publishing has been involved with the Shibboleth project for the past two years and was one of the first content providers involved in live Shibboleth tests. This talk will share their experiences in implementing Shibboleth as well as their perceptions on how well Shibboleth can meet the goal of seamless single sign-on for our academic customers. Issues discussed will range from the implementation of the technology, aligning the user with groups or departments level accounts for a given institution, handling multiple link-in options and determining when a user is authenticated via Shibboleth.

2003,2003-10-03,4:15 - 5:30,,Birds of a Feather Sessions,"The Birds of a Feather sessions (or ""BoFs"") are informal breakout sessions focussing on a topic of interest to participants. They are scheduled for 4:15 - 5:30 pm on Friday, Oct. 3.

Contact John Durno (jdurno@ola.bc.ca) or Mark Jordan (mjordan@sfu.ca) to suggest a session. You may also want to begin a discussion prior to the Conference using the BoF forum on the Web Board.

So far, we have confirmed BoFs on the following topics:

    Open source software for libraries (Michael Hohner, University of Winnipeg)
    OpenURLs and authentication (George Loney, University of Guelph)
    Virtual reference (Andrée Côté Moxon, Donna Dinberg, Nicolas Savard, Bibliothèque nationale du Canada / National Library of Canada)
    Content Management Framework for website publishing (William Oldfield, University of Waterloo)
    OpenILL open source ILL management system (Mark Leggott, University of Winnipeg)
    Information Commons in Academic Libraries (Leslie Firth, Carleton University) 

BoFs have also been suggested for the following topics. These BoFs will not be confirmed until someone (maybe you!) agrees to moderate them. Please contact Mark Jordan or John Durno (see above) if you are interested in moderating one of the following sessions:

    Metasearch implementation in libraries
    W3C's XML Query work and its impact
    OLAF - Open Library Application Framework
    reSearcher project

BoFs need not be formal: discussions often develop during coffee breaks or presentation question periods that may interest a number of people. Since space for these sessions at the Conference hotel is limited, however, people interested in leading a BoF on site may want to suggest it get added to the list above.

2003,2003-10-04,8:45 - 9:45,Clifford Lynch (CNI),Cliff's Notes,"A perennial favourite at Access. Cliff�s Notes is a survey, from Clifford�s unique perspective, of trends in digital libraries, information policy, and emerging interoperability standards. A miscellany of topics �to keep on your radar screens�.
Kenton Good's summary:
Security - The state of network and web security is really bad. Routers and switches are under attack as well as hardware with embedded processors - not just end computers or servers. How often do you upgrade the firmware on your printers? The pace of problems has really picked up as well. The time window between when problems and patches are announced and when exploits happen is growing ever smaller. The monoculture of desktop computers (microsoft) also creates a lot of problems - there is just not diversity.

Spam - problem at a large scale, not just annoyance. Email is becoming less reliable because of spam filters. This is starting to change the perception that people have of the internet as a communications medium.

Domain Names - Verizon/Network Solutions is now rediecting failed lookups back to the Verizon host - in an effort to try and sell their products.

Broadband Radios - based on wireless technology. High speed wireless (g) at home will be a distrubtion channel for home entertainment. For example, radios that know how to talk to your computer.

Stresses and Strains on the Internet - we are seeing the effects of giving out ill-advised patents on technology. These can mess up standards and deployment. Examples include current problems with streaming media patents. The good news is that the EU has been looking at software patents and takes a more conservative position on this.

Personal Digital Libraries - we are seeing people start to build large collections of electronic music and videos. Also the downloading of entire collections of journals and other content.

2003,2003-10-04,9:45 - 10:30,"Lee Iverson (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC)",Digital Library Research Agendas,"Libraries serve communities. This role begins with the choice and organization of collections, and continues through the choice of services offered. However, the relationship that modern research libraries have with their user community is primarily organized in terms of providing collections and services to individuals as members of communities, rather than to the communities themselves. This session will describe a more expansive model for this relationship and some of the research that will need to be done to realize that model.

The research program to design and build the right tools involves consideration of social epistemology, the sociology and anthropology of communities, semantics and knowledge management, user modelling, human-computer interaction and web-based collaboration infrastructure. The impact, however, could go well beyond the walls of the library and the academy, potentially affecting patterns of work in any organization that depends on the effective exploitation of the knowledge of its members.",talk,,,,
