2001,2001-09-27,2:15 - 3:00,Glen Newton (CISTI),Duluth: A Virtual Library Portal Management System,"Duluth is a web-based system allowing web-naive domain experts to create parallel hierarchical taxonomies of web resources (URLs). Duluth allows these experts to uses these taxonomies to manage information, and users of the taxonomies to find this information. Users have a 'read-only' view, allowing them to navigate and search the taxonomy based on the classification labels ('subjects'), groupings (hierarchy-specific classification), and various URL resource metadata attributes, such as title, type, keyword, etc. Users can register interest in changes to parts of the taxonomy and have Duluth contact them periodically with these changes. The parallel taxonomies share a common metadata base of canonically classified URL resources. This allows for greater scaling of expensive and usually scarce human classification resources. Duluth presently supports two languages, English and French. Duluth is implemented in Java using the Java Servlet architecture, and is Open Sourced. It is the result of a research and development effort at CISTI.",talk,,,,

2001,2001-09-28,8:45 - 9:30,"Eric Hellman (Openly Informatics, Inc.)",OpenURL Framework,"The proposed OpenURL standard is syntax to create web-transportable packages of metadata and/or identifiers about an information object. Such packages are at the core of context-sensitive or open link technology, which has recently become available in scholarly information systems. By standardizing the syntax, we will enable many other innovative user-specific services in this and other information fields. Conventional web links do not take into account the identity of the user: they take all users to the same target. This causes some problems. For example, when more than one institution provides access to copies of the same electronic article, the link from citation to full text should resolve to a copy that is accessible to the user. Since different users have access to different digital libraries, the link should resolve in a user-specific fashion. I will discuss the profound impact that link servers based on OpenURL such as SFX and 1Cate will have on digital library architecture. I will also discuss CrossRef and how you can use it today. Please see the OpenURL committee's homepage at <library.caltech.edu/openurl/> for more information.",talk,,,,
2001,2001-09-28,9:30 - 10:15,Norm Friesen,CanCore - Metadata for Learning Object Repositories,"""Metadata"", ""repositories,"" and ""educational objects"" are terms used to describe a new vision for the widespread sharing and reuse of digital educational resources for classroom and distance education settings. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of this vision, focusing specifically on the central role of metadata in facilitating the discovery, reuse and management of these educational resources. This overview will begin by introducing the concept of educational objects, and the metadata that can be used to describe them. The paper will then focus on the Canadian Core Protocol (CanCore) as a ready-made metadata solution with the potential of providing single-click access to distributed educational resources. Finally, it will describe how the Canadian Core can achieve this type of accessibility in the context of a variety of repository architectures and distribution models.",talk,,,,

2001,2001-09-29,8:45 - 9:30,"Lloyd Davidson (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL)","Digital Rights Management, Anarchy, Or...","Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems (encryption or other mechanisms that enclose and protect digital objects and control their access and use) are likely to prove to be the key to the development of viable digital publishing on the Internet. Nevertheless, the companies developing these products are having a remarkably difficult time finding a secure footing in the rapidly shifting economic sands generated by the rapidity and of digital developments. The general economic instability of Internet technologies and significant decrease in venture capital, a lack of standards, an excess of product variety and complexity, user resistance, and a plethora of very talented software hackers have all conspired to make it very difficult for DRM systems companies to attract customers willing to trust and utilize their protection programs. The result of this is that none of the DRM corporations have even begun to approach profitability. Recent changes in U.S. copyright laws, however, such as the Draconian Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), have made the success of DRM systems considerably more likely, at least in the long run. It seems probable that such changes in the legal environment, along with company consolidation and the development of improved security technologies, will ultimately lead to the commercial success of at least a few members of this industry. Indeed, the general implementation of such technologies of restriction and control seems inevitable. The significant impact of the spread of such technology on libraries and scholarly communication, both positive and negative, will be explored, based on projections derived from recent developments in the field. These will include a discussion of the use of the U.S. DMCA to prosecute programmers who have had the temerity to decrypt such protective envelopes, the recent sale of un-copyable CDs, and the publication of a timed-use ebook by RosettaBooks that utilizes the Reciprocal DRM system.",talk,,,,
2001,2001-09-29,9:30 - 10:15,Willem Scholten,"Future of the ILS - Closed, Open or Free?","Library automation has made great progress over the years in providing powerful, although some would argue, now somewhat antiquated, means of accessing information. Although automation systems have proliferated, most poorer communities in the US and abroad do not have access to such systems. These communities are deterred not only by the considerable cost, but also by the systems' ever-increasing requisites for high-end computer equipment. For these hard to reach communities, efforts to provide state of the art tools for both managing local collections and providing access to web and other electronic resources must take into account the lack of funding and, more importantly, the lack of bandwidth. With this in mind, the Technology Resource Foundation has set out to build a library information organization tool that would be ""hardware independent"". Called OpenBook, this powerful tool supports all the important library standards, MARC21, Z39.50 and emerging XML for libraries, and uses the web browser exclusively for all opac and staff operations. OpenBook is supported by a set of readily understood Open Source tools such as PHP, Perl, Apache, MySQL and Linux operating systems. Because its server hardware requirements are minimal (a typical new server can be obtained for around $500), and since its client access hardware can be anything capable of running IE 4.0 or later or Netscape 4.5 or later, access is thus made possible even on the lowest end Pentium 90 machines. This presentation will explore how, in light of the OpenBook effort, the question of ""Closed, Open or Free"" may be posed in an important new way.

2001,2001-09-29,2:00 - 2:45,Stewart Granger,CEDARS and CAMiLEON Projects,"Recent years have seen a massive increase in the range and volume of digital information resources and their acquisition by libraries. The CEDARS Project (CURL Exemplars in digital archives) addressed the strategic, theoretical and practical issues of digital preservation and provides guidance on best practice. CEDARS produced practical demonstrators and adopted an OAIS compliant architecture. The project is now producing its final reports. A 'sister project' CAMiLEON (Creative Archiving at Michigan and Leeds: Emulating the Old on the New) began in October 1999 with the specific aim of evaluating emulation as a digital preservation strategy. Results from both projects will be presented.

One of the most interesting experiments is a Web accessible name authority file layered on top of the OAI protocol. The Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) has a draft metadata standard based on Dublin Core which includes linking to authority files via URIs. OCLC now has an experimental file available incorporating OAI URL links to a version of the LC name authorities. ",talk,,,,
