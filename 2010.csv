2010,2011-10-14,8:30-9:30,Hal Niedzviecki,What Libraries Can Learn from Peep Culture,"In the era of peep culture, we are learning to love watching ourselves and our neighbors. We are turning away from pre-scripted entertainments, from movies and books and pop music, and spending more and more time amusing ourselves by watching the real life travails of other people on Facebook, Twitter, webcam, YouTube, Reality TV and more. In this talk, Hal Niedzviecki will explore the lessons libraries can take away from participatory voyeurism as entertainment. He will focus, specifically, on how libraries might adopt new roles in the age of peep culture as facilitators, educators, and collectors. Niedzviecki will argue that libraries have an important role to play in the age of peep; a role they most embrace if they are to avoid becoming nothing more than free Internet terminals providing access to an endlessly crisscrossing, contradictory and experimental network of authorless opinion.",keynote,"internet culture, social media",,,
2010,2010-10-14,9:30-10:15,Lisa Fast (NeoInsight),Usability Testing and the Google Generation,"Usability testing sessions for a major university library site and other sites reveal a number of user behaviour patterns related to frequent use of Google. In this session, we'll present examples of those behaviours in clips from usability testing sessions, and discuss methods of working with those patterns rather than against them. These patterns influence a range of usability approaches on a site, from developing student research skills all the way to general navigation patterns (or lack thereof). Awareness of these types of behaviour trends and experience with the data from many users on different sites is one of the advantages of hiring professional usability consultants. However, there are many do-it-yourself options for usability testing - we'll discuss this range and the pros and cons of the various approaches.",talk,usability,,,
2010,2010-10-14,10:45-11:30,Daniel Brindle-Moczuk (U Victoria) | Peter Peller (U Calgary),Open Access / Source GIS & Open Access GeoSpatial Data,"At approximately $1000 a site licence for a commercial GIS software package, fully functional open access/source GIS is a very attractive alternative to libraries, students and other potential users. In addition, there is more open geospatial data being made available. This session will detail open access GIS and available data. (It will not focus on the coding of the open source GIS.)",talk,GIS,,,
2010,2010-10-14,1:30-2:00,"James McDonald (UNBC, Prince George, BC) |  Carolee Clyne (UNBC, Prince George, BC)",Mobile Technologies: iRoam,UNBC library is finally confident that there is a mobile device capable of making roaming reference services both easy and enjoyable; is our confidence justified? This session will explore a pilot project at UNBC library to offer roaming reference services using Apple's new iPad. The session will cover the technical difficulties encountered (security and networking issues) as well as issues around training and marketing the service.,talk,"mobile, reference",,,
2010,2010-10-14,2:00-2:30,"Rob Zylstra (Yellowhead Regional Library, Spruce Grove, AB)",Mobile Technologies: Goin' Mobile,"The mobile revolution is here. With the passing of each month, library patrons expect more from their library, whether that be the convenience of searching for a book while riding the bus or paying fines online. Driving these expectations are businesses who invest in technology to bring their products conveniently close to consumers. Is your library ready to compete with major league companies armed with massive marketing budgets? How important is it for your library to market a mobile platform for your patrons? Yellowhead Regional Library, an Alberta library system that serves 44 public libraries, has identified mobile technology as an achievable goal for 2010. Many of the libraries that are part of the region are in growing municipalities with increasing technological expectations, so providing new and innovative approaches to library service has become a priority. Together with technology partners Polaris Library Systems and HybridForge, Yellowhead Regional Library released an iPhone/iPod Touch App in March and an iPad App in May. Attend this session to learn more about how and why Yellowhead Regional Library released a mobile catalogue, as well as what they have in store for the future.",talk,"mobile, app",,,
2010,2010-10-14,2:30-3:15,Karen Coombs (OCLC),Enhancing Library User Interfaces with Web Services,"Past library discovery tools were focused on information held in local systems such as the Integrated Library. However, increasingly library users have desired better information to make decisions. As a result, more recent discovery tools have grown to include information from external sites and services such as Amazon. Today there are a variety of web services which can provide data which can be used to enhance library discovery interfaces. Open Library contains bibliographic data, covers, and author information. LibraryThing offers covers, ratings, awards and honors and a variety of other metadata. The New York Times offers an API for their best seller lists, movie reviews, and articles. OCLC Web Services such as xISSN, WorldCat Search API, WorldCat Identities, and the WorldCat Registry provide a variety of data which can be used to enhance and improve current library discovery interfaces. This talk will discuss several simple ideas to improve current users interfaces using data from these web services. Javascript and PHP code to add journal of table of contents information, peer-reviewed journal designation, links to other libraries in the area with a book, also available as, info about this author, covers, reviews and ratings, similar items will be discussed.",talk,"OCLC, WorldCat, API",,,
2010,2010-10-14,3:45-4:30,"Dan Scott (Laurentian University, Sudbury, ON)",Standard Social Sharing and Aggregation on the Go,"Web applications such as Google Buzz, Facebook, and others are working on interoperability standards such as Activity Streams, XFN, and Salmon for publishing and aggregating social conversations in a semantically meaningful manner. These conversations increasingly take place on mobile devices, adding location awareness to the mix. This session exposes the current state of the relevant standards and explores the possibilities of enabling library applications such as resolvers, catalogues, and mobile reading devices to participate in the wider social sphere.",talk,"social media, standards, sharing",,,
2010,2010-10-14,4:30-5:15,"Brent Nelson (U Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK) | Craig Harkema (U Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK)",A New Model for Publishing the Scholarly Electronic Edition,"The standard model for publishing digital editions of literary works has three major problems to contend with: a long lag time between initiation of the project and publication of results; unsustainable demands of time and financial resources; and the almost complete invisibility of the resource to the scholarly audience that they are prepared for. This paper proposes a publishing model that is closely integrated with the university library for the acquisition and preparation of materials in the form of digitized facsimiles of original printings; for storage and public access to the digitized material; and, most importantly, for making the published material easily findable by adding its metadata in the host library's catalogue and thus, ultimately, WorldCat and Google Books. The John Donne Society's Digital Text Project proposes such a model for its first line of publications in collaboration with the special collections department of the University of Saskatchewan's Murray Library and Texas A & M's Cushing Memorial Library and Archives. This paper will elaborate the rationale for this model in light of the changing role of university libraries and the new importance placed on cooperation between teaching faculty and librarians. It will then outline the proposed model for collaboration between the John Donne Society's Digital Text Project and the these university libraries, illustrated with samples of the e-books that will be produced. Rather than fully featured Web-editions, these will be down-loadable e-books in pdf format produced by XSLT transformations of lightly encoded texts using TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) markup in XML. This first line of publications will enable the JDS Digital Text Project to begin producing texts quickly with minimal commitment of resources, and, most importantly, these e-books will be catalogued and searchable like any other book in the university's catalogue system.",talk,"scholarly publishing, ebooks",,,
2010,2010-10-15,8:30-9:30,Maureen Doyle (Heritance and Open Museum),Mobeum: Open Museum's Mobile Service,"Executive Director of Heritance and founding member of the Open Museum team Maureen Doyle, will discuss the Open Museum’s Mobile service, Mobeum. She will present the outcomes of Mobeum pilot projects, including the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. Maureen will explore preferences, challenges, and barriers to use for the various participants (including visitors, our museum partners and Open Museum itself) and look at the lessons learned about the technical, content, and social aspects of a mobile Web access project in museums. Furthermore, Maureen will explain the relationship between Mobeum and Open Museum, a not-for-profit participatory exhibit space that allows any not-for-profit cultural organization to share their collections and engage their audience online.",talk,"museums, mobile",,,
2010,2010-10-15,9:30-10:15,Andrew Nagy (Serials Solutions) | Charles Lowell  (Serials Solutions),A peek at the development of Web-scale Discovery,"A unified index for searching the entire library collections is what we have all be dreaming about for years.  Many have attempted, few have succeeded – it is a very expensive and difficult undertaking.  At Serials Solutions, we have accomplished just that with Summon.  This talk will review our agile development strategies and how we involve user feedback in development, how we acquire such a massive amount of content, how we keep relevancy tuned as well as a look at the core of our functionality, the Summon API.",talk,"discovery, agile development",,,
2010,2010-10-15,10:30-11:30,Randy Oldham (University of Guelph) | Janet Kaufman (University of Guelph),A Human Library: Every Book Its Reader,"What is a Human Library? The idea behind a Human Library is to meet face-to-face with individuals who belong to groups that often face challenges due to broad generalizations, stereotyping, misunderstanding and even marginalization. The University of Guelph Library has held two Human Library events.  We will share how we managed over 350 thirty minute appointments occurring over a two-day period, using a University-wide registration system that we 'tailored' to suit our needs.  We'll also provide some tips for organizing an event like this and give you a peek inside the event itself.",talk,human library,,,
2010,2010-10-15,1:30-2:30,"Daniel Chudnov (Library of Congress, Washington, DC)",Content Transfer Services at the Library of Congress,"LC's in-house Content Transfer Services (CTS) environment went live in mid-2009. Through a year of regular use in automating workflow for verifying millions of pages of digitized newspapers and web archives data, we improved usability, added many new features, and integrated our application with complementary products to fit a wide range of potential users. In 2010 we are adding several new collections to the system and working with new curators to further refine, extend, and integrate CTS to fit a wider range of content types, users, and the requirements of both. We'll take a look at these tools, how they fit together, and where we hope to take the system next.",talk,,,,

2010,2010-10-15,3:45-4:30,"William Denton (York University, Toronto) | Adam Taves (York University, Toronto)","After Launching Search and Discovery, Who Is Mission Control?","Reference librarians are whiny and demanding. Systems librarians are arrogant and rude. Users are clueless and uninformed. A new discovery layer means that they need to collaborate to build it and then - the next step - integrate it into teaching and learning. How should we (reference librarians, systems people, and users) work together to better exploit the possibilities of open source systems so we can focus on discovery and understanding instead of the mechanics of searching?",talk,"discovery, reference, systems",,,
2010,2010-10-15,4:30-5:15,Ralph LeVan (OCLC),OCLC Open Source Linked Data Framework,"OCLC Research is exposing records from an ordinary text database as Linked Data using an Open Source framework. The URI http://viaf.org/viaf/123 points to a Real World Object which generates a 303 redirect to a Generic Object: http://viaf.org/viaf/123/. The Generic Object supports Content Negotiation for retrieving HTML or RDF. Other formats can be supported. Generic Objects can also have file-type suffixes and objects returned as a consequence of Content Negotiation will have Content Location headers that include the appropriate file-type suffix. The Open Source components supporting this behavior are OCLC's SRW server with its SRWLucene interface, a Lucene database, the URLRewrite filter from Paul Tuckey and the Content Negotiation component from Pubby. As a bonus, the SRW server supports the Atom Publishing Profile for performing CRUD operations on the objects stored in the text database.",talk,,,,

How does virtual work evolve? What influences are at play? These ideas are being explored during a joint venture between the University of Manitoba Libraries and the University of Prince Edward Island in the continued development of Islandora. Created at the University of Prince Edward Island, Islandora is an open source framework that combines the Drupal and Fedora software applications to build a trusted digital repository.

2010,2010-10-16,9:15-10:00,David Lindahl,eXtensible Catalog - Take control of library metadata and websites,"The eXtensible Catalog Project has developed four open-source software toolkits that enable libraries to build and share their own web- and metadata-focused applications on top of a service-oriented architecture that incorporates Solr in Drupal, a robust metadata management platform, and OAI-PMH and NCIP-compatible tools that interact with legacy library systems in real-time. XC""s Metadata Services Toolkit allows libraries to orchestrate and sequence metadata processing services on large batches of metadata. Libraries can build their own services or choose from our initial set of metadata services that clean up and ""FRBRize"" MARC metadata. XC software provides an RDA metadata test bed and a Solr-based metadata ""navigator."" XC""s user interface platform is the first suite of Drupal modules that treat both web content and library metadata as native Drupal nodes, allowing libraries to build web-applications that interact with metadata from library catalogs and institutional repositories as well as with library web pages. Other currently-available XC toolkits expose legacy ILS metadata, circulation, and patron functionality via web services for III, Voyager and Aleph (to date) using standard protocols (OAI-PMH and NCIP), allowing libraries to easily and regularly extract MARC data from an ILS in valid MARCXML and keep the metadata in their discovery applications ""in sync"" with source repositories. This presentation will showcase XC""s metadata processing services, the metadata ""navigator"" and the Drupal user interface platform. The presentation will also describe how libraries and their developers can get started using and contributing to the XC code.",talk,"discovery, OPAC",,,
2010,2010-10-16,10:30-11:30,Karen Keiller | Pat Nicholls | Lynn Copeland | John Durno | Janneka Guise | Marc Comeau,Talkin' 'bout my generation,For as long as most of us have been alive we've been hearing from and about the baby boomers. Some of us are boomers and some us are just hoping that they will finally retire and get out of our way! This will be a lively panel discussion with two retiring boomers and two newer librarians. Questions for the boomers: What was it like in the days of punch cards? How much change have you witnessed? What advice do you have for the new generation of systems librarians? Questions for the younger generation (born before 1964): How will you do things differently once the boomers are out the door? Will you miss them? What would you like the retiring generation do before they walk out the library for the last time? Audience participation will be required!,talk,generations,,,
