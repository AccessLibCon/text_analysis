2009,2009-10-01,8:30-9:30,Cory Doctorow (Boing Boing),Copyright vs Universal Access to All Human Knowledge and Groups Without Cost: The State of Play in the Global Copyfight,"The Internet promises the realization of two of humanity's noblest dreams: universal access to all human knowledge and the capacity to form and coordinate groups at virtually no cost. As great as this sounds, it's bad news for certain kinds of top-heavy organizations and the kinds of companies that got rich on exclusion from information. From the UN to shady back-room ""plurilateral"" treaty negotiations, from the blogosphere to staid standards-committees, the fight over the future rages, with diplomacy and activism at its core.",keynote,,,,
2009,2009-10-01,9:30-10:15,"Richard Akerman (National Research Council, Ottawa)",Will We Command Our Data? ,"This presentation provides an overview of recent drivers contributing to the increasing availability of datasets from four sources: research, government, libraries and individuals.  Libraries now have to be able to manage datasets from the petabyte-sized outputs of big science, down to the small individual data files that may be part of the new cultural record.  The presentation also discusses some recent activities related to datasets and the implications for libraries.","talk, binkley",,,,

This presentation will address the software lifecycle (e.g. zombieware) and sustainability issues that invariably arise with many software development projects, especially open source initiatives. At the same time, it will provide an update on the status of various PKP and reSearcher modules that are illustrative of these larger concerns.",talk,,,,
2009,2009-10-01,1:00-1:45,"Dan Chudnov (Library of Congress, Washington, DC)",Chudnovian Stuff ,"The Repository Development Group at the Library of Congress builds infrastructure and applications which support digital content transfer, ingest, access, and preservation functions. In 2009 we have been active in several areas:  multi-lingual access to rich historical items from around the world in the World Digital Library (http://wdl.org/), historical U.S. newspapers in Chronicling America (http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/), and infrastructure development for automating the workflow of content receipt, ingest, validation, inventorying, and deployment.  We also began to release software under Open Source Initiative-approved licenses (http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/) and continued working on specifications such as BagIt (http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/library/challenge/data-transfer.html) as well as promoting Linked Data at LC through Chronicling America and the Authorities and Vocabularies service (http://id.loc.gov/). I'll review these activities and highlight some lessons we've learned along the way, and describe some of the things we'll be working on next.",talk,,,,
2009,2009-10-01,1:45-2:30,"Donald Moses (UPEI, Charlottetown, PEI), Paul Pound (UPEI, Charlottetown, PEI)",IslandLives: A Flexible Digital Repository Framework,"In 2008 the Robertson Library received a private donation “to develop a rich repository of the history of the people of Prince Edward Island”. We have completed the first stage of the project - the digitization of all of the published community histories on Prince Edward Island - and have been focused on developing and integrating a storage, search, and discovery system based on Islandora - middleware that connects the Drupal CMS and the Fedora repository framework. We'll discuss various facets of the project including: digital rights, automating workflows for data processing, developing user tools (image viewer and metadata editor), engaging the community, security and issues we have had along the way.",talk,,,,
2009,2009-10-01,2:30-3:15,"Stevan Harnad (UQAM, Montreal)",Grasping What is Already Within Immediate Reach: Universal Open Access Mandates,"Open Access (OA) means free online access to peer-reviewed journal articles (about 2.5 million articles per year, published in about 25,000 journals across all scholarly and scientific disciplines) in order to maximize the usage and impact of research by making it freely accessible to all potential users and not just those whose institutions that can afford to subscribe to the journal in which it happens to be published.There are two ways to provide OA:(1) publish in an OA journal, which makes all its articles free online (""Gold OA""); or(2) publish in a conventional, subscription-based journal, but make the peer-reviewed final draft free online by ""self-archiving"" it in your institution's OA repository immediately upon acceptance for publication (""Green OA""). Gold OA depends on publishers and entails author publication fees if subscriptions do not cover publication costs. Green OA entails no extra cost, depends only on authors, and can be and is being mandated by their universities and research funders. Yet, for some reason, it is always Gold OA that keeps capturing the imagination and attention of all concerned (""gold fever""). Universal OA is long overdue even though it is already within the research community's immediate reach. I will argue that OA's biggest and most important priority today, and the one that will deliver universal OA swiftly and without certainty, is hence the immediate universal adoption of Green mandates by universities and funders. All the rest (publication reform, copyright reform) will come with the territory, with universal Green OA. But not if we keep failing to grasp what is already fully within our reach.",talk,,,,
2009,2009-10-01,3:45-4:07,Roy Tennant (OCLC),ILS in the Sky with Diamonds,"Cloud computing has become all the rage, but what does it mean, and how will it impact libraries? What does it mean to move library management services to the cloud? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks? What are some of the emerging options and how do they differ? These questions and more will be explored in a look at cloud computing for libraries, and some specific solutions in particular.

But which bucket should we grab? And can we really, truly fit all the data in one bucket? And don't we risk turning data into sludge if we mix it all together in our bucket?Finding a bucket is the easy part. Grappling with data acquisition, modeling, discovery, and reuse is hard. How will we do it? Can we?",talk,,,,
2009,2009-10-02,1:45-2:30,Roy Tennant (OCLC),Inspecting the Elephant: Characterizing the Hathi Trust Collection,"The Hathi Trust is a collaborative digital repository that holds millions of items -- many of them publicly available at one or more Hathi Trust
institutions. This fast growing collection of digital content has the potential to vastly enrich access to information, but copyright issues will shape what we can access for some time to come. Some preliminary work by OCLC Research has sought to characterize the collection by processing the data in various ways. This talk will discuss both the findings as well as the strategies and tools used to perform the analyses.",talk,,,,

Either a run-of-the-mill cell phone, a smart phone (blackberry, iPhone) or maybe even a PDA. Because of this, it is essential for libraries and universities as a whole to offer services to their users that are mobile friendly.

This presentation will show off some of the latest work in mobile apps for libraries.",talk,,,,

2009,2009-10-03,9:15-10:30,"Cathy Hartman (University of North Texas Library, Denton, TX), Mark Phillips (University of North Texas Library, Denton, TX)",The Portal to Texas History,"The Portal to Texas History is a multi-institutional repository for digitized cultural heritage objects hosted by the University of North Texas Libraries.

In the past four years the Portal has grown to over 100 members from around the state and contains over 60,000 photographs, books, letters and newspaper issues. Several methods for contributing to the Portal have been established and are taken advantage of by the partners depending on their needs and skills.

This presentation discusses the different models for funding the work, adding content to the system, workflows and tools developed to facilitate the digitization process, and finally tools developed for distributed metadata creation and metadata analysis. The models in place are easily adapted to other projects of a similar nature as well as providing guidance to collection building activities such as building an institutional repository at a research institution.",talk,,,,

We need to balance these acquisition activities with complimentary teaching and learning activities in order to support the academic integrity policies of our institutions -- requiring students to give appropriate credit to the sources used in their assignments. I have spent the past year exploring student behaviour within this digital environment, asking the question: What are we doing to help students collect, manage, annotate and cite the digital sources they find and want to use? At our university, we have a site license for RefWorks. This digital tool can assist both novice and expert researchers. It is comparable but different than Zotero, a new open source research tool developed by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. This free extension for the Firefox browser enables students to perform a variety of activities which support digital scholarship. This session will present observations from two levels of user behaviours -- that of the students conducting their research using digital content and that of the libraries as they navigate between being a purchaser of a commercial product and being a member of an open source community. This presentation will also include an update on the EndNote/Zotero lawsuit.",talk,,,,

Turkel (University of Western Ontario, London, ON)",Hacking as a Way of Knowing,"Researchers are familiar with the idea of digitization, converting text, images and sound into digital form. New technologies allow us to turn all of those bits back into atoms, through reverse processes of materialization. It's not quite Star Trek (yet), but desktop fabrication and ubiquitous computing allow us to create artifacts, devices, exhibits and environments that can shape people's experience of place, community and the past.
