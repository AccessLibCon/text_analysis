2004,2004-10-14,8:45 am - 9:45 am,Andrew Pace (NCSU),Dis-Integrated Library Systems: Promise and Peril,"The Integrated Library System (ILS) as we have come to know it is finished. First loosely integrated, then more fully so, the ILS has finally arrived at a plateau of innovation, where ""state of the art"" is the best a library can hope for. Inevitably, the legacy technologies of the ILS are clashing with web innovations. The web creates opportunities, challenges, and expectations that are fueling changes in the ILS.

Librarians are dismantling systems, and creating new modules, out of frustration with the inflexible and non-extensible technology of their proprietary systems. Vendors are also creating standalone products both to harness newer technologies and capture or invent new market shares. In the newly dismantled library system, many expect that new modules will communicate with old ones, products from different vendors will work together, and a suite of existing standards will make distributed systems seem transparently whole. Today, interoperability in library automation is more myth than reality, and some wonder if we may lose more than we gain in this newly dismantled world.",keynote,,http://libconference.acadiau.ca/access2004/presentations/pace.ppt,,
2004,2004-10-14,9:45 am - 10:30 am,Roy Tennant (California Digital Library),"Bitter Harvest: Metadata Harvesting Issues,
Problems and Possible Solutions","Metadata harvesting using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is still in its infancy. Although there are many institutions that are exposing metadata for digital collections (data providers) using this protocol, there are only a small number of service providers (those who aggregate metadata for searching). But the experiences of pioneer service providers is exposing a number of issues and problems with metadata harvesting that will require concerted effort by both data and service providers to solve. These issues, problems, and possible solutions will be identified and explored by using real world examples.",talk,,http://libconference.acadiau.ca/access2004/presentations/tennant1.ppt,,
2004,2004-10-14,11:00 am - 11:45 am,"Slavko Manojlovich (Memorial University, St. John's, NF)","Resource Sharing Initiatives in Atlantic Canada:
The Standards Dilemma","It would be difficult to imagine building any type of computer-based service for libraries without the availability of standards like Z39.50, NCIP, OpenURL, MARC, etc.. Yet, we constantly stumble/trip in our implementations because of problems associated with the standards, or more importantly, our interpretation of the standards. The session will cover some standards related gotchas encountered in the development of the Atlantic Scholarly Information Network’s Resource Discovery and Management Service (ARDMS).",talk,,http://libconference.acadiau.ca/access2004/presentations/gotchas.ppt,,
2004,2004-10-14,11:45 am - 12:30 pm,Clare MacKeigan (Relais International),Document Delivery Standards,"Because of the very nature of Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery they have relied upon and embraced standards from their inception. The recent push to automate and more closely link and integrate these with other library services has further emphasized the need for and importance of standards, e.g., ISO ILL, Z39.50, OpenURL and NCIP. However, the adoption and implementation of standards such as these can be a mixed blessing for all parties involved. This session will address Document Delivery Standards – ‘the real world’.",talk,,,,
2004,2004-10-14,1:30 pm - 2:15 pm,Jenny Walker (Ex Libris),"Collaborative Efforts towards Effective Metasearch:
the NISO Metasearch Initiative","The key stakeholders in the metasearch arena – libraries, content providers and metasearch service providers – are actively collaborating through the NISO Metasearch Initiative towards a set of standards and best practices to deliver effective metasearch services to researchers and other library users. The scope of the Metasearch Initiative reaches beyond the search and retrieve process itself to encompass issues such as Collection Description and Access Management that are also key to successful metasearch. This session will discuss the key issues currently being addressed by the Metasearch committee and will report on the current status. This session will also touch on other metasearch related areas such as Statistics and Metasearch Identification; and will report briefly on the continuing deployment of metasearch tools in libraries around the world.

and Retrieve:The Next Generation Z39.50","Building on the experience gained with the Z39.50 information retrieval protocol standard, a group of Z39.50 developers coordinated by the Z39.50 Maintenance Agency worked for the past two years to move the concepts of that protocol into a web services application. Their efforts resulted in the recently released specifications for the Search/Retrieve Web Service (SRW). SRW is an XML oriented protocol designed to be a low barrier to entry solution to performing searches and other information retrieval operations across the Internet. This presentation will provide an introduction and overview to this exciting new approach for interoperable information retrieval.

2004,2004-10-14,4:15 pm - 5:00 pm,Diane Vizine-Goetz (OCLC),ePrints UK,"The ePrints UK project is developing a series of national, discipline-focused services through which the higher and further education community can access the collective output of e-print papers available from compliant Open Archive repositories, particularly those provided by UK universities and colleges.

Discipline-focused views of available eprints will be provided through the use of an automatic subject-classification Web service offered by OCLC. The classification service will be based on the 22nd edition of the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC 22) published in 2003. More information about the project, and further technical details can be found at http://www.rdn.ac.uk/projects/eprints-uk/ and http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/mswitch/epuk.htm.

2004,2004-10-15,8:45 am - 9:45 am,David Seaman (Digital Library Federation),Mass and Malleability: the Collaboration Imperative,"Libraries exhibit a deep-seated belief in the imperative nature of collaboration -- of librarians and our institutions' faculty and students; of librarians one with another across institutions; of libraries with related industries; and of collaborative digital library objects themselves, working together across collections in machine-aided working spaces.

Many of our current delights, possibilities, and frustrations are bound up with collaborative failures and successes; often, our sense of what we could do is thwarted by content that fails us in our desire to discover it quickly, bend it to our purposes, and engage actively with it. Much more content, and much richer, domain-sensitive, finding systems are vital, as is the ability to enrich, re-shape, re-package, annotate, and contextualize the data once we have found it. This presentation will chart the course of current developments in digital library best practices, policies, and technical developments as we craft the libraries, users, and digital content we want to achieve to move us beyond the buzz and hype.",talk,,http://libconference.acadiau.ca/access2004/presentations/seaman.ppt,,

Information Infrastructure for Canada","The Canadian Initiative on Digital Libraries is promoting a national vision for a cohesive approach to digital collections for and about Canada and Canadians. Libraries and their knowledge institution partners can contribute indexing and digital content to a collectively designed national system that maximizes coordinated efforts toward content building (indexing, scanning, etc.). This session will delve into the issues and benefits of such a national infrastructure and how it will minimize: the need for expensive systems, duplication of effort and software development experience.

Brian will speak first 20 min or so on the national vision and efforts thus far to build a cooperative digital collections initiative. This will be a broad based discussion highlighting the positive elements of such a course, including standards, communication of expertise, software sharing, support in identifying funding, etc. -

Eric will speak for 20 minutes or so on the Nova Scotia and local experience, providing on the ground examples of what Brian outlined. Highlighting the multi-sector cooperative venture of the NSDCI, how it came into being, some of the early plans and where we are heading now. Will also highlight the community side of the venture that has allowed for strategic partnerships with non-traditional agencies that can provide resources. -

We felt that a separate portal approach was not desirable, so we have started developing a personalized view of our standard library website. The value of re-use of resource information and integration with our ILS will be highlighted, as will the speed of development and functionality.",talk,,http://libconference.acadiau.ca/access2004/presentations/leggott.ppt,,
2004,2004-10-15,11:45 am - 12:30 pm,John Durno (University of Victoria),"BCcampus: One stop, many shops
- Library Services on the Expedia Model","The goal of the BCcampus project is to provide a central access point to online and distance learning courses, programs and resources offered by 27 publicly funded post-secondary institutions across British Columbia. BCcampus students have the option to enroll in courses offered by any post-secondary institution in the province, and may be affiliated with several different course providers at any time during their educational career. All courses and support services are accessible via the BCcampus Portal, a uPortal implementation.

Designing a gateway for library users with multiple, changing institutional affiliations has been a key challenge in the development of library services for BCcampus. A central focus has been to implement an authentication infrastructure enabling students to access electronic library resources from multiple institutions using a single sign-on. Existing system-wide library services including an ILL requesting system have also been modified to work in the BCcampus context.

This session will provide an overview of the BCcampus project, focussing on the technical and design considerations involved in constructing a library gateway for students affiliated with multiple post-secondary institutions.

2004,2004-10-15,1:30 pm - 2:15 pm,"Elaine Toms (Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS)",Integrating User Context to the Digital Library,"Digital libraries manage resources for their community of users. Yet community needs for those resources are limited by the ""bag of words"" approach to retrieval that is practiced by search engines and library systems. These systems are very good with well-defined, known-item searches, such as find a hotel in Rome, or the Webpage of X, or a particular article or report. But searches that require multiple pieces of evidence to solve complex problems, such as who should not get a flu shot, are significantly less successful. The solution lies in adding contextual data from the user's personal/work environments into the retrieval process, and enriching the interface to digital libraries so that it more closely reflects the user's environment. This talk will address this problem proposing how the addition of user context will define the next generation of digital library with prototypes to illustrate.",talk,,,,
2004,2004-10-15,2:15 pm - 3:00 pm,"Peter Webster (St. Mary's University, Halifax, NS)","E-content database administrative services.
A critical and comparative review.","Web accessible administrative services are an essential management tool for serials databases and online library resources offered by vendors like Gale, Ebsco, Proquest, CSA and Elsivier. These administrative services offer basic resource linking, off-site validation, and interface customization. Their statistical capabilities largely determine what information we have about usage of online services. These built in administrative tools are often our first point of contact with existing and immerging standards, from Z39.50 to ""Counter compliant statistics"", to Crossref and Open URL Linking, or Digital Object Identifiers.

This session will present a review, and comparative critique of many popular databases' administrative services. It will look at the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of these tools. The session will look at the growing standardization of administrative services, which vendors are falling short and which are taking services to new levels.

It will consider the scalability, and versatility of these products. The session will explore the features which will be necessary to library management as the number of online products grows greatly in the next few years. It will look developing capabilities which might profoundly change the management of online resources in the future.",talk,,,,

- beyond buzzwords","TUG (the TriUniversity Libraries- Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier and Guelph), expanding on their collaboration in a shared library system and shared storage facility, is developing a shared Electronic Resource Management (ERM) system for the delivery of Electronic Journals, Electronic Reference and Journal Indexes databases. This program will deliver these three services from a single database while allowing more local branding than possible with the current shared system. The ERM system will eventually be used for other services like electronic theses, electronic reserves as well as any database that any of the three Libraries may wish to deliver.
