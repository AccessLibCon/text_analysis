2007,2007-10-11,8:30am-9:30am,Jessamyn West (librarian.net),"Opening Keynote: Web 2.0, Library 2.0, Librarian 2.0 - solving problems with buzzwords","Library 2.0 as a concept is not complicated and not even that new. Making institutions interactive and more flexible and responsive to their patrons is a necessary part of being part of the networked world. As technology knowledge becomes mandatory for participation in society, libraries are becoming one of very few bridges spanning the digital divide.",keynote,,,,
2007,2007-10-11,9:30am-10:15am,Benoît Pirenne (Neptune Canada),Archiving the NEPTUNE and VENUS observatories data,"The VENUS and NEPTUNE cabled ocean observatories are going to produce an estimated total of about 47 TB of data year. Dealing with the storage and retrieval of this data is the role of the Data Management and Archiving System currently being developed. More importantly, ways and means to collect processed data, paper references and other anciliary information from scientists for the sake of linking it back with the original data will be more of a challenge and an area where library experience will hopefully come to our help.",talk,,,Video - PowerPoint,
2007,2007-10-11,10:45am-11:30am,Richard Wallis (Talis),The Talis Platform,"The concepts behind the Talis Platform were first introduced by Paul Miller at Access 2006.

The session will include an environmental scan of the ILS market in Canada supplemented by personal evaluations of the major ILS players including, but not limited to, Ex Libris/Voyager, III, SirsiDynix and Evergreen, a relatively new open source solution.",panel,,,,
2007,2007-10-11,3:15pm-4:00pm,Ray Siemens (University of Victoria),Scholarly Reading Interface to Renaissance English Knowledgebase,"The Renaissance English Knowledgebase (REKn) contains a combination of digital representations of primary literary and artistic works of the Renaissance (some 13,000 works at present), plus secondary materials reflecting our understanding of these earlier works (some 100,000). These materials are accessed through a reading interface, PReE, supported by a database system that facilitates their navigation and dynamic interaction, also providing access to inquiry-oriented analytical tools beyond simple search functions. The effect is that of providing an expert reading environment for those in our field, one that encourages close, comprehensive reading at the same time as it provides, conveniently, the building blocks of broad-based research inquiry. My talk will discuss REKn and PReE from both theoretical and pragmatic perspectives, focusing on the way in which an advanced computational approach can add significant value to the way in which one interacts with such materials.",talk,,,Video - PowerPoint,
2007,2007-10-11,4:00pm-5:00pm,"Mark Leggott (University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PEI)",Repository Redux,"The University of Prince Edward Island has embarked on a substantial project to support the institutions Administrative, Learning and Research communities using a Web 2.0/3.0 framework and the Fedora/Drupal/Moodle systems as the foundation.

2007,2007-10-12,9:30am-10:15am,Martin Holmes (University of Victoria) | Chris Petter (University of Victoria),Image markup and Web applications,"MaP is a tool for the markup and display of very large images on the web. It is mostly used for displaying maps with overlays, but can be used to display any image. Images can be marked up with the HCMC Image Markup Tool or the open source Inkscape drawing program. The Scraps project will produce a web-based system to mark up and display multi-level digitized artifacts, such as scrapbooks, albums, etc. The Image Markup Tool is used to mark up the digitized images. The Scraps administration program uses the IMT files and other user-supplied data to create a hierarchical structure that is displayed by the Scraps viewer. Users can drill down through the layers of the hierarchy to view embedded objects.",talk,,,,

2007,2007-10-12,1:00pm-1:45pm,"Shawn Martin (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI)","Darth Vader, Open Access, and Digital Libraries: What is the Future of Electronic Collections?","This session will look at the complexities of open and closed access business models used to create digital libraries. Often, those of us in the academic world, tend to think of open access models as “good” and closed ones as “evil.” The reality, however, is much more complex. Digitization costs money, lots of it, and, at the same time has to respect the ability of authors (both corporate and scholarly) to benefit from their work whether through monetary profit or through promotion and tenure. Therefore, the question for all of those who wish to provide access to digital libraries is how do we navigate between these different philosophies? In other words, how do we eliminate both the “Dark Side” (closed access), and the “Light Side” (open access) and create a “Gray Side” (compromise)?","talk, binkley",,,,

This session reports on AlouetteCanada’s status and accomplishments during its first 18 months of activity.",talk,,,,
2007,2007-10-12,3:15pm-4:00pm,"John Durno (University of Victoria) | Martha Whitehead (Queen's University, Kingston, ON)",Genius Loci: Libraries in Transition,"Our success in providing electronic access to information — ejournals, ebooks, mass digitization, collaborative storage of print copies — is paving the way for the disappearance of the physical library… or is it? What should we be addressing right now in our organizations to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of the continuing shift to networked and open access? What clues do we have from our users? Drawing on the results of the 2007 Canadian Consortial LibQUAL+ survey and on their amiably conflicting perspectives, the speakers will paint two different scenarios for tomorrow’s academic library and the organizational implications of each.",talk,,,,
2007,2007-10-12,4:00pm-4:45pm,Luc Declerck (UCSD) | Declan Fleming (UCSD Libraries),"Data-Cyberinfrastructure Collaboration at the University of California, San Diego","In recent years both the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) have released reports on the coming need for appropriate cyberinfrastructure for engineering, sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines. An important question for any research library is where and how they will fit into the cyberinfrastructure model that is native to their campus, community and or university system? At the University of California, San Diego, the University Libraries are actively pursuing this agenda by working collaboratively with the San Diego Supercomputer Center to build an intersect of personnel, expertise, and services to provide long-term preservation of and access to research data and enable domain scientists and researchers to carry-out longitudinal complex data analysis to support interdisciplinary research. Presenters will describe the collaborative model, identify benefits and challenges, give a brief outline of the projects already underway, expose the key components of the technical architecture, and discuss future plans.",talk,,,,

2007,2007-10-13,8:30am-9:30am,"Peter Binkley (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB)",Searching the OPAC: The State of Play,"In the past few years libraries have started to take action on their dissatisfaction (and their users’ indifference) towards their OPACs. The concurrent emergence of options for search interfaces outside the ILS and the wide adoption of Web 2.0 applications by our users have provided both a carrot and a stick. This session will examine the current range of possibilities for improving search functionalities in, around and begainst the OPAC.",talk,,,Video - PowerPoint,
2007,2007-10-13,9:30am-10:30am,Joshua Ferraro (LibLime),Open Source Software as a Service,"Many in the library industry are excited about the recent availability of companies offering commercial support for ‘Enterprise Open Source’ solutions. This session discusses the successes and challenges of operating a high-growth open source business in the library industry from the point of view of the owners/operators of one such company. Questions and issues to be raised and discussed include: Why the need for commercial support for open source? How can the needs of a business be balanced with those of an open source project? What challenges to the success of this business model exist in the library industry? How can open source companies successfully collaborate (i.e., avoid a fork) while competing on services? Should libraries try to convince more library companies to “Go Open”? If so, how can they plead the case? How scalable is the “Sponsored Development” model, where customers are responsible for providing resources for feature development?",talk,,,Video - PowerPoint,
