2011,2011-10-20,9:00-10:00,"Jon Beasley-Murray (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC)",From Access to Interactivity,"The issue of “access” is in the first place about providing the public with the goods generated by public institutions. This should be obvious: universities exist for the public good, and the knowledge and skills that they develop should be immediately available to the public. With the rise of digitalization, the Internet, and the various technical capabilities for almost unlimited reproduction and dissemination of information, this should be the heyday of the university as an organization oriented towards the common good.

But despite the best efforts of many within the institution, in fact the university’s reputation has reached a new low. In part this is because of the work of lobbies that struggle valiantly against access at every level (rapacious academic publishers, for instance). In part it is because of a new right-wing populism that denigrates the very notion of the public and scorns any effort of the state to foster or protect the common good. But in part is is also because the university has been slow to realize the possibilities enabled in this new information age.

My talk will examine what I have elsewhere called “Knowledge 3.0″ and outline the ways in which universities should proactively encourage engagement with the new forms taken by the public sphere and the common good in the twenty-first century. This entails not merely sitting back and allowing the public to access the halls of academia. It also requires an interactive intervention into the new ways in which knowledge is produced and disseminated.",keynote,"access, knowledge 3.0, access copyright, borges",,,
2011,2011-10-20,10:00-11:00,Jer Thorp (New York Times),Embodied Histories & The Weight of Data,"Every day, each of us is adding to our own immense data inventory. Mobile phone records, social network conversations, purchase histories – all of these things are being stored, often without our knowledge or express permission. In this presentation, Jer will discuss how these data histories can be accessed, visualized and explored. He’ll show a variety of projects, including work from The New York Times R&D Group, the 9/11 Memorial in Manhattan, and Popular Science. He’ll walk through collaborative processes, admit to a series of spectacular failures and ultimately show how custom software tools can be made to solve extraordinary data problems.","keynote, binkley","data visualization, art, processing, Dave Binkley",,,
2011,2011-10-20,11:30-12:15,MJ Suhonos (Artefactual Systems) | Peter Van Garderen (Artefactual Systems),Big Data in Libraries: Has Open Source’s Time Arrived?,"Libraries and consortia have a long history of managing millions of resources by their very nature. However, administering and maintaining such vast quantities of data has generally remained a task that was only achievable by large software vendors and research cooperatives that could afford the systems to do so. At the same time, technology has advanced exponentially in the past few decades while the nature and complexity of library metadata has remained relatively unchanged. Open Source software in particular has grown rapidly in less than a decade, and a number of free tools designed for working with humongous amounts of data have recently matured significantly. This presentation will share the experiences and lessons gained during a detailed technical analysis of software performance on a data set of almost four million archival records. Both relational (SQL) and document-based (NoSQL) software architectures are compared and characterized, and the results reveal a number of implications for institutions looking to manage, index, and search massive amounts of metadata. Especially given the recent rise in popularity of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and cloud-based service offerings, has the time come for libraries to take control of the security and scalability of their own big data?

It is widely acknowledged that one of the most important parts of a Free software project is the community. But how does that community evolve? What dangers does it face? How do you deal with the multicultural and multilingual realities of a worldwide community? Koha is a 11 year old project to build a free software ILS. As the project has grown in popularity it has had to overcome several challenges. This presentation will cover how we have grown the community, how we have overcome these challenges and where we can go from here.",talk,"open source software, koha, ils, lessons learned",,,

2011,2011-10-21,9:00-10:00,"Kimberly Christen (Washington State University), Alex Merrill (Washington State University)",Open to the Public: Indigenous Collections and the Ethics of Openness,"In the last twenty years collecting institutions have heeded the calls of Indigenous activists to integrate Indigenous curatorial models and knowledge systems into mainstream museum and archive practices. Web 2.0 technologies grounded in user-generated content and bottom-up exhibition and display modes have aided in producing a dynamic platform for sharing materials. This newly animated digital terrain, however, poses both possibilities and problems for Indigenous peoples as they seek to manage, revive, circulate and create new cultural heritage on their own and in collaboration with collecting institutions. While digital technologies allow for objects to be repatriated quickly, circulated widely and annotated endlessly, these same technologies pose challenges to Indigenous communities who wish to maintain traditional cultural protocols for the viewing, circulation and reproduction of their cultural materials. In these cases it is precisely the celebrated ease of circulation and lack of control that intrudes on and erases many Indigenous models for the circulation, reproduction and preservation of cultural knowledge and materials. Librarians are especially attuned to the nuances of collections materials as they seek to make resources available for multiple publics with oftentimes-divergent interests. Issues of access are paramount to librarians as they seek to make collections available in both physical and digital form. This presentation engages with engrained assumptions about the general public good of making collections accessible and the ethical dilemmas facing information specialists as they seek to negotiate the variances between Indigenous knowledge systems and their professional imperative to make collections “open to the public.” Specifically we will discuss the creation of the Plateau Peoples’ Web Portal, a reciprocally curated online archive of Native collections. We will discuss the projects goals, its technical foundation and its ethical underpinnings and provide a framework for ethical curation models and practical digital asset management in collaboration with Indigenous communities.",talk,,,,

2011,2011-10-21,11:15-12:00,William Wueppelmann (Canadiana.org),Canadiana Discovery Portal Metadata and API,"The Canadiana Discovery Portal was launched in the spring of 2010. By the end of its first year, it had indexed the metadata for about a million digital objects from a variety of libraries, museums, archives and galleries. Its goal is to be a centralized metadata repository for all of Canada’s digital content, accepting metadata from anyone who wants to contribute it, and exposing that metadata both interactively and through a Web service API. We’ll look more closely at the metadata ingest and normalization standards we’ve developed as well as the public Web API for searching and retrieving the collected metadata.",talk,API,,,

We’ll keep the pace fast, and the answers faster. Come with questions and line up at the start of the session and we’ll go through as many as we can; sometimes we’ll stop at finding the right person or people to answer a query and it’ll be up to you to find each other after the session. Questions via Twitter or IRC will also be accepted. First time at Access!

2011,2011-10-21,3:45-4:30,"Paul Joseph (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC) |Will Engle (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC) | Julie Mitchell (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC)","Gardening the Wiki, Growing the Web: Transforming UBC Library’s approach to content management through UBC Wiki","Over the last two years, UBC Wiki has transformed UBC Library’s approach to content management. Working in conjunction with multiple WordPress websites as delivery tools, UBC Library staff are able to use the wiki as an open space to collaborate and build online content that is automatically republished across multiple UBC Library and University websites. This process challenges previously locked-down content management systems, and empowers staff to edit and share content to benefit the campus community. UBC’s Centre for Teaching and Learning Technology (CTLT) are driving this innovative approach, providing several web publishing services to the UBC community, including WordPress (as UBC CMS) and MediaWiki (as UBC Wiki). Multiple faculties, departments, and individual users, including UBC Library and the Learning Commons, have been adopting the wiki as a convenient centralized repository for web that offers the capability to seamlessly push content to multiple websites. This session will feature a panel of four speakers who worked collaboratively on this innovative approach to content management at UBC. Two CTLT staff members (Novak Rogic, Manager, Web Strategy, and Will Engle, Wiki Administrator) will speak from their perspectives of building and administrating the UBC CMS/Wiki service. Two Librarians (Julie Mitchell, Learning Commons Coordinator, and Paul Joseph, Systems Librarian) will address how the UBC Library is effectively using the system as a shared knowledge base and publishing UBC Wiki content to various UBC CMS websites.",talk,content management,,,
2011,2011-10-22,9:00-9:45,Heather Piwowar (University of British Columbia),"Open research data: fun, important, and in need of librarians","The results of research studies are communicated through conference papers and journal articles. The datasets behind the results — spreadsheets containing collected data, for example — are usually hidden from view on investigators’ hard-drives.  Thanks to the wonders of the internet it is now possible to host academic research datasets online, thereby making research data open and widely available for confirmation, reanalysis, and integration.  The revolution toward more efficient and inclusive research progress through data access is just beginning.  This presentation will highlight the promise of open research data and why academic (and public!) libraries and librarians are necessary as advisors, educators, and data hosts.",talk,,,,
