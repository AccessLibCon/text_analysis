2017,2017-09-29,3:30 - 4:30 pm,Nora Young (CBC),Information and Meaning in the Data Boom,"In the last 20 years, computers have gone from desktop behemoths (remember those giant CRT monitors?) to powerful devices we carry in our pockets, on our wrists, and even in our glasses. Increasingly, the boundaries between the physical world around us, and the digital world of our devices, are blurring, thanks to AR, VR, and wearables. Beyond what we carry with us, computing is spreading out into the world around us in the form of the Internet of Things. What were formerly separate “virtual” and “IRL” experiences, are now braided together. We are now fully in the Age of the Data Boom. From an era when data and information were top down, scarce, and tightly curated, we now find ourselves in a world where data and information are bottom-up, dynamic, chaotic, and as freely available as turning on a water from a faucet. Much of that data is from us, about us. It can power vital tools, from machine learning to building smarter cities. But the Data Boom comes with security concerns baked in: witness the recent Equifax data breach of sensitive personal information, or the news that hackers broke into a casino’s network through its “smart” fish tank! Nora Young talks about the challenges and opportunities for libraries in this exciting and often chaotic world.","keynote, binkley, cancelled",,,,
