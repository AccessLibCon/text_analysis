2013,2013-09-24,9:15 – 10:15,Roy Tennant (OCLC),"""What a Long, Strange Trip It’s Been""","The last twenty years have seen incredible changes in libraries, society, and ourselves. Where were we in 1993 and how did we get where we are today? What were our successes, our failures, our laughably lame attempts to make progress? You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll want to punch your neighbor or throw things at the speaker. Try to behave yourself as we take a rollicking look back at where we’ve come from and discover how on earth we made it this far alive.",keynote,,,,

2013,2013-09-24,10:45 – 11:30,"Nick Ruest (York University, Toronto) | Anna St. Onge",Gettin Sh*t Done in the Digital Archives,"We live in a reality where official documents are born, revised and disseminated online. Most post-secondary institutions have record retention schedules to facilitate the transfer of official records with lasting historical value to the archives. Implementing similar practices in the online environment is challenging, in part due to an organizational culture that does not view websites as official university records, but rather as transactional, fluid spaces, despite the fact that such spaces are increasingly the only source of important documents. In addition, economic pressures and cutbacks in the university sector makes enterprise level electronic records keeping systems out of reach for many. These challenges cannot be met with a single solution. We need to work strategically to collaborate on long-term plans to ensure that born-digital records find their way into the archives.

We will focus on our efforts within the library to capture and preserve a selection of websites and communications that document York’s campus activities, in a manner that is systematic and accessible. We will report on our efforts to pilot this approach both within the university environment and in the wider community. We will reflect on our efforts to share our practice, successes and failures publicly, working within events in which we have a personal or philosophical investment. A keynote speaker at a recent archival conference admonished the profession that “once one becomes an activist, one has lost one’s perspective and objectivity as a public servant.” We aim to test this assertion and demonstrate that ‘active’ professionals can contribute to the preservation of our own institutional memory, and document the wider online social movements shaping our collective experience.

2013,2013-09-24,11:30 – 12:00,Andrew Nagy,Reinventing Discovery: An Analysis of Big Data,"As the late Steve Jobs would say, don’t listen to your customers, they don’t know what they want. Usability studies and live user analysis provide valuable feedback about your product or web site in terms of how the tool is used, but listening to the users about what they want out of the tool can result in a “whack-a-mole” scenario where you solve a problem for one user, but create new problems for other users. Analyzing usage data can provide a very different perspective on how live users actually use the tool and allow you to identify different personas and use cases. This talk will share how Serials Solutions collects and analyzes a dataset of queries and clicks generated by millions of users at hundreds of libraries around the world to find behaviors, patterns, successes and failures in the interface design and search algorithms and then how we leverage that to improve and redesign. We will share the details of our custom developed data warehouse system and how we leverage these tools to perform our analysis. We will also share with you before-and-afters that were developed based on the results of the ongoing analysis.",talk,,,,
2013,2013-09-24,1:30 – 1:50,"Jason Casden (North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC)",Building crowdsourced photographic collections with lentil and Instagram,"In January 2013, the NCSU Libraries opened the James B. Hunt Jr. Library at North Carolina State University. Telling the story of the new library was crowdsourced through an Instagram-based project called My #HuntLibrary. Developed collaboratively by our Digital Library Initiatives, Communications, and Special Collections departments, My #HuntLibrary is both a user engagement tool and a digital preservation effort. Photographs tagged #HuntLibrary are included in a collection that is displayed in multiple interactive, responsive views, ranging from four inches to twenty feet. The entire collection of digital images will be preserved in our digital archives.

In May 2013, the My #HuntLibrary code was released as an open-source Rails Engine called “lentil” in order to simplify the creation of similar projects. lentil is a framework for applications that harvest image metadata from Instagram, provides moderation, browsing, voting, and sharing tools, and harvests image files and submits donor agreements in preparation of ingest into external repositories. A lentil-based application can be quickly customized and deployed to any Rails-capable web server (including Heroku) as a complete crowdsourced photographic documentation project.

lentil serves as a platform for investigating questions related to library approaches to user engagement, the preservation of social media, large-scale interface design, and including new participants in digital archival materials creation and selection processes. This presentation will present insights based on user interviews, application usage data, image contributions, social media feedback, voting (community curation) trends, and experience integrating these materials into existing digital collections systems.",talk,,,,
2013,2013-09-24,1:50 – 2:20,Peter Binkley (University of Alberta),First Decade: Done and Dusted,"Our flagship digitization project was launched ten years ago. As digital custodians, we were tasked by our director to think about preservation in the 500 year time frame. At the 2% point, it’s worth pausing to take stock.

Over the past decade our content has piled higher and higher, and ramified into a variety of new types: research data sets, user-contributed files of every variety in the institutional repository,etc. Media and the possible physical infrastructures for preservation have developed. The concept of the Trusted Digital Repository has been defined and necessary policy framework has been laid out. Opportunities for partnerships over distance and preservation in the cloud have emerged. The role of the library as the preservation agent in the research community has been both affirmed and questioned.

We have responded to these changes in various ways over the years. We have ramped up from megabytes to gigabytes to terabytes. We have migrated our core content from platform to platform. We have handled new content through a variety of channels involving partnerships with OCUL and Internet Archive. We have expanded our staff and our breadth of expertise. We are deploying a new platform this summer.

This talk will draw the trajectory of our experience of the past decade, and try to project it into the next 490 years. Listeners will gain a high-level view of the challenges and opportunities of digital preservation, grounded in a narrative of a decade of practical experience at a peer institution to which they can compare their own experiences.",talk,,,,
2013,2013-09-24,2:20 – 2:50,"Todd Holbrook (SFU, Burnaby, BC) | Calvin Mah (SFU, Burnacy, BC)",The SFU Library Open Data API,"The SFU Library has built an Open Data API. Information that is normally stored in non public accessible databases such as library hours, real time computer availability, and current items on reserves could previously only be accessed by our own website and developers. An Open Data API allows us to easily share this data with other units on campus, and the rest of the university community.

The SFU Library Open Data API was first created to share items on reserves information with other units on campus. The question arose to what other data can we make available? Information such as which computer workstation is currently occupied could be shared. The data that creates our library hours is also made available.

The open data movement has become popular in the last few years. Most of the open data initiatives have been initiated by government. Libraries have traditionally not become involved in either being neither a consumer nor producer of open data. The SFU Library Open Data API is a modest start, but by developing generalized shareable interfaces we can make our own information open and available.",talk,,,,

Designed with flexibility in mind, this program is capable of mapping and displaying all sorts of unique content and collections by identifying a contents type (DVD, Books, Reserve, etc..) and applying rules to only search material within that context.

Yet, library administrators have traditionally been circumspect about admitting failure — or taking risks that may lead to failure — perhaps for good reasons. An unfortunate result of avoiding failure is that doing so often precludes experimentation and innovation.

Within the predominant organizational culture in libraries, numerous subcultures exist side-by-side. The core subcultures — technical services, public services, and collections, to name three — tend to define the overall culture, while the subculture of library IT often remains on the periphery. The pace of broader IT innovation also far exceeds that of the library’s natural evolution, creating an inherent conflict of pacing that must be constantly negotiated.

Experimentation is common within library IT subculture and potential resultant failure is not typically perceived as negatively within IT as it is in most other areas of the library. Systems librarians are generally pragmatic and don’t trust potential solutions until they experiment with them. They learn from failure and try something else. Library IT administrators are sometimes caught between the try-it-and-see-what-happens culture of IT staff and the usually more cautious practice of library management.

The members of this panel will share their views on fostering a culture of innovation and why library administrators should embrace experimentation and risk and develop strategies for managing failure in positive ways. While the panelists may describe specific examples from their experience, this session is not intended to be a series of case studies. Panelists will take a cultural approach to exploring risk, failure, and innovation to suggest ways to build more productive, agile, and relevant libraries.",panel,,,,

2013,2013-09-25,9:00 – 9:45,Heather Pretty (Memorial University) | Catelynne Sahadath (University of Calgary),"From the Cloud to the Ground: Cataloguing, Linked Data and RDA Search Strategies","In the decision to move from AACR (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules) to RDA (Resource Description and Access), the international cataloguing community has recognized that the cataloguing formats and standards of the past have constrained how we as cataloguers – and thus our patrons – have come to think about how we access library materials.

RDA, based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), is a fundamental change in how we think about the metadata connecting the increasingly wide variety of material we catalogue. After briefly reflecting on where we’ve come from, Heather Pretty will summarize the library world’s path to Linked Data thus far, and some of the ideas for our next steps.

In the second portion of the session, Catelynne Sahadath will address some of the practical changes to the library catalogue. She will introduce practical examples of search strategies that public services librarians can employ to optimize results in RDA and AACR2/RDA hybrid environments.",lightning,,,,

Too often, our library discussions have centered on the loss of the book artifact with not enough attention being given to the new forms of the book enabled by the web. In this presentation, we
will look at a beta HTML5 framework developed for a Montana State University History class project to publish a book in the browser (http://arc.lib.montana.edu/book/home-cooking-history-409/). Along with an analysis of these possibilities in the library setting, we will survey current efforts to remake the book in the web development and publishing world and bring the discussion to Access. Among the technical highlights we will discuss:

– Applying CSS3 to help create linear, readable layouts
– Building microdata to create structured data that turns books into APIs
– Creating searchable and findable content with semantic HTML5 markup
– Analyzing new metrics of interaction and use that are enabled by this new form
– Using web services and APIs to supplement and enhance the reading experience

Beyond the technical demonstrations and code samples, we will ground our discussion in the concept of the evolving book—what it means for the book as a medium to be hyperlinked, marked up, styled, and analyzed as a full participant in the web of data. Come learn about the possibilities and get energized as we rethink and explore new forms of reading by bringing our primary artifact, the book, into the networked environment.",talk,,,,

The service is currently managed using the Ares application by Atlas Systems, and receives course and enrolment data in real-time via an enterprise message bus and restricts access to reserves in all courses and sections based on enrolment. The presentation will begin with background on the teaching and learning context at UBC — changes to the university’s copyright environment, the decision to implement Blackboard, and the need for UBC Library to provide an electronic course reserves service. It will touch on the decision to select Ares as a starting point and to provide access to it solely in the context of Blackboard. The presentation will then highlight the implementation of the system, focusing on three key data integrations for the provision of the service — integrated enrolment and library data, user access to the LMS integrated with the delivery of contextual library services, and the integration of the Summon API to expedite the instructor requesting process and to expose the library’s collections to faculty and students. The presentation will end looking to the near future at some exciting new developments for the course reserve service at UBC followed by a demonstration of the service, providing details on the integration of the different systems as well as insights into the development process, challenges, complexities and concomitant benefits.",talk,,,,
2013,2013-09-24,11:15 – 12:00,"Corey Davis (Royal Roads University, Victoria, BC)",Can they scale? Library discovery tools and new forms of scholarly communications,"The lately emergent discovery ecosystem is thriving, and its attendant technologies—which include discovery layers, link resolvers, and bibliographic knowledgebases—are seen by most academic libraries as essential. But as technology drives entirely new forms of scholarly communications, the systems and standards behind library discovery—including OpenURL and bibliographic knowledgebases—are showing limitations and calling into question the comprehensiveness of tools like Summon, Primo, and WorldCat Local. Hybrid journals, research data sets, and digitized special and archival collections all present unique challenges to systems built primarily around enabling discovery and access to monographs and paid-for journal articles. So how are discovery tools adapting to this new environment? This session will share the results of focused interviews with vendors of discovery products, such as Serials Solutions, Ex Libris, and OCLC, concerning the technical challenges of providing access to new forms of scholarly output. Attendees will learn the issues involved in surfacing open access research publications in centralized consolidated indices, the challenges of linking to such content, and how vendors are planning to move forward in this area. They will also be provided with a critique of the current discovery ecosystem in handling heterogeneous information resources, especially in contrast to information retrieval methodologies used at search engines like Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search.",talk,,,,

This is a long-term project, with primary digitization expected to take about two years and supplementary metadata creation and curation estimated to be a ten year endeavour. The project presents multiple challenges: technical, logistical and financial.

This presentation will provide an overview of the project and a report of its progress over the first six months. It will also outline the long-term strategic plan for managing digitization; the creation and linking of enriched metadata; long-term preservation of and enduring public access to the resulting content; and the funding model that will (we hope) actually pay for it all.

If successful, Canadiana hopes that Héritage will serve as a model for large-scale open access digitization projects that can be applied to the enormous body of as yet undigitized Canadian documentary heritage.",talk,,,,

the most concerning parts of this process is the storage component, and
as new and larger objects and collections come under libraries’ care,
the pressure to find long-term storage solutions is growing. There are a
lot of solutions vying for mind-share — many of them commercial — but
it’s unclear the extent to which these solutions really represent
sustainable alternatives. But what if there were a way for us to do
this? Not “us” you or me, but “us”: you *and* me. What if “us” is all of
us in the country? What does that mean for sustainability, and the
future of trustworthy repositories? If we could do this, what might it
look like? Are there models in place elsewhere that might help inform
what this Canadian solution might look like?

This session will discuss issues around sustainability with a variety of
commercial storage options and compare those with the significant
potentials created by a series of recent, open-source driven,
developments in the hardware and software worlds. We’ll talk about what
software and APIs are available to make a locally created storage
network accessible to your applications, and will demonstrate how you
can build a scalable community cloud storage solution using commodity

A steadily decreasing number of vendors continue to compete in a vicious oligopoly, while at the same time, a booming number of open-source projects are challenging established business models.

Within this environment, libraries are facing massive budgetary cuts, staffing freezes, and increasing technology licensing costs as vendors seek to retain profit margins. While libraries reluctantly weigh their vendor relationships, lack of funding for open-source software development makes for a frustrating lack of options in a shrinking industry. Much like the serials crisis before, the de facto “wait-and-see” stance has become untenable for systems librarians.

We now need to search for sustainable and scalable business models that can disrupt the existing market and provide much-needed alternatives. A startup is “a partnership or temporary organization designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” And yet, in a time that seems ripe for a surge of library startups, we are yet to see more than a handful. Why?

How can we balance organizational agility and sustainability? Whose responsibility is it to develop technology solutions? How do we minimize risk while incentivizing innovation? Where is the support for startups who can disrupt the library technology sector?

In the case of research data repositories, the answer has so far been a solid “maybe.” Discipline-specific repositories with some history, like ICPSR or arXiv, have tended to fare better than university institutional repositories over the past several years. There are many possible explanations for why this may be the case, but in general it seems safe to assume that institutional repository-style deposit is not sufficiently consistent with or salient to researchers’ existing workflows. Thus it must come with some additional incentive – a stable home for “green” open access materials, and/or some additional visibility which allows the work to be more easily cited, and credit received for that citation.

When surveying our faculty for the features they most wanted to see in our new data repository platform, one of the most common responses was “Dropbox.” BC privacy laws currently preclude SFU faculty from making use of cloud services whose servers may be located in the United States – that is, in effect, all cloud services – and while our CIO has made an outreach effort to explain how and why to obey this policy, in some cases, there is no effective functional equivalent to status-quo cloud services, and some faculty have freely admitted to paying for cloud services while being unable to claim their cost due to university policy.
