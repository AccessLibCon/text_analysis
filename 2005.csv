A critical component in making this happen is to adopt a model of continuous assessment that uses user-centered decision making. Learn what forces are shaping this ""culture of assessment"" and what you can do to get started using this methodology.",talk,,,,

2005,2005-10-17,11:45am - 12:30pm,Gene Smith (Atomiq),Sorting Out Social Classification: Folksonomies and Tagging In Practice,"Folksonomies are communal classification schemes created by aggregating tags, simple keyword metadata attached to web content by thousands of users. Folksonomies and tagging gained wide acceptance in the past year through innovative online services like Flickr and Technorati, as well as flattering articles in Salon, Wired and the New York Times.

The remarkable success of folksonomies seems to up-end traditional thinking about classification and information architecture. They work even though they lack controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, facets and other hallmarks of a well-organized information space. As one pundit says, “the old way creates a tree; the new rakes leaves together.”

This session will look at folksonomies in practice—how they’re created, how they can be used, the value they can provide, and the drawbacks of user-created classification schemes.",talk,,,,

","The Simon Fraser University Library has been developing and supporting software for nearly ten years. Most of this development has been done on behalf of consortia and has been largely centralized within the SFU Library, but with the recent shift of the Public Knowledge Project’s software (Open Journal Systems, Open Conference Systems, and the PKP Metadata Harvester) to SFU in early 2005, the Library is evolving new development models. This presentation outlines some of the challenges and opportunities the SFU Library is encountering as it increases the scope of its activities to make them more collaborative, distributed, and sustainable.",talk,,,,

2005,2005-10-18,8:45am - 9:45am,"William Moen (Universtiy of North Texas, Denton, TX)","Keynote: A Radioactive Metadata Record Approach for Interoperability Testing Based on Analysis of Metadata Utilization
","This presentation describes how funding from two Institute of Museum and Library Services Research and Demonstration National Leadership Grants is being used to:

explore an alternative approach for interoperability testing in the context of Z39.50 clients and servers, and MARC-based online library catalogs (Z-Interop2 Project)
produce empirical evidence regarding library catalogers’ use of MARC content designation (MARC Content Designation Utilization Project).
The Z-Interop2 Project has developed a method for interoperability testing using specially designed diagnostic MARC bibliographic records, which we call Radioactive MARC Records. These records support interoperability testing to assess Z39.50 protocol interoperability, information retrieval search functionality, and local indexing policies. These factors can affect the extent of interoperability between systems. Further, we have developed test scripts that automatically send test searches, retrieve results in the form of one or more of the diagnostic MARC records, and generate reports of search success or failures. Automating these processes substantially improves the efficiency of our interoperability testbed. Several sets of diagnostic MARC records have been created, differing in the content designation populated. Determining the fields and subfields to populate is based on analyzing the frequency of occurrence of the content designation in a large set of MARC records. A preliminary analysis of 400,000 MARC bibliographic records from OCLC’s WorldCat database indicated about 5% of available MARC content designation accounted for over 80% of all occurrences. Further analysis is being undertaken in the MARC Content Designation Utilization Project. We believe that the alternative approach to interoperability testing can be extended to address other protocol and metadata environments, and similarly, the methodology for analysis of MARC content designation utilization can be adapted by other metadata communities to assess the utilization of different metadata schemes.",keynote,,,,

Mark Leggott and Bess Sadler","The Olive digitization process is used by many libraries for OCR scanning of books and newspapers. However, this process leaves the library with proprietary PRML XML files that usually must be published by purchasing ActivePaper (TM). Martini provides an open source alternative, allowing libraries more flexibility in their web presentation of Olive files as well as other XML files, such as TEI. Libraries with multi-lingual collections and/or patrons will be especially interested in Martini's internationalization features, which make creating an interface in a new language easy even for non-programmers. Martini was developed for the Manitobia.ca project, a collection of newspaper and other historical materials.

","In addition to its own standard interface, Metalib, one of the premiere federated search systems used by libraries today, provides an XML-based API known as the X-Server. Little known and rarely used, the X-Server nevertheless offers libraries the ability to create highly customized metasearch systems and portals, ultimately producing more usable and powerful research tools. This session will include a brief introduction to the X-Server and showcase implementations at the California Digital Library, the Interactive University Project at UC Berkeley, and Cal State San Marcos.

","Federated Search has long been an elusive goal of the library community. Traditionally, Z39.50 tools offered the ability to perform federated searches across library catalogues and other metadata repositories. Now, with the explosion of Web Services and their associated flexibility, the creation of innovative Federated-type searching is made possible. We will discuss these issues, and present an Open Source prototype which uses Z39.50, Web Services, and REST to query a number of databases, including the CISTI catalogue, PubMed, and Amazon. This prototype also allows users to purchase books from Amazon and view full-text articles from PubMed and via CISTI's link resolver.

","Not enough funds to purchase all the new OPAC's your library needs? Do you have a closet full of old PC's that are too slow to run a modern web browser, but you can't bring your self to throw them out? Turn those old PC's into ""Thin Clients"" and use them as additional OPAC's for your library. This way the old computers can harness the power of a modern server. All of this without breaking your IT budget. We will discuss pro's and con's to this solution and demonstrate the client and server software. At the end of the session participants will be able to intelligently discuss the pro's and con's of thin client solutions.

","Collaborate!!! The message is loud and clear in discussions regarding IT based service development. The very nature of IT projects and services dictates that success results from effective collaboration. Our community can boast that we are skilled collaborators, as is evidenced in our numerous consortial system implementations and development initiatives. However, IT has diffused information services and resources, allowing content and services to break out of library systems and traditional containers. The resulting possibilities and opportunities demand new partnerships. We must now collaborate throughout our academic institutions with faculty, students, teaching support services, student services, central computing services, the registrar and on and on. While these relationships are not new to us they are changing dramatically. Libraries are redefining their role in scholarly communication and the support of teaching, learning and research, and have some way to go yet to develop a campus-wide understanding. This makes collaboration management a significant component of emerging information services and technology initiatives such as institutional repositories, campus portals, course management system integration, and open access publication. It takes time and skill. It takes leadership and requires the identification of external champions to realize full potential. Please join in on a discussion of collaboration management and its impact on today's information services and technology initiatives.

","Libraries, historically, have maintained strict standards and rigid controls in regards to its data. The web, in its brief history, has done anything but. The emergence of technologies such as GreaseMonkey and A9's Opensearch is giving us the opportunity to “unbutton our collars”, as it were, and open up, reconstitute and push out our goods and services in exciting new ways.

","There are nodes and networks. In a material world, the node provides entry and aggregation opportunities. In a dematerialized world, the network, or networks, become much more important. This presentation will explore some ways in which library functions switch from the node to the network, and some of the service and organizational implications that flow from this.

","This year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Vannevar Bush's article ""As we may think"". In it Bush proposed a machine called the ""Memex"", that would store all of an individual's books, records, and communications; and he described a system of ""trails"", akin to but richer than today's hypertext links, that would establish and document paths through information resources to illustrate a particular conclusion or thought process on a particular problem. Today, powerful and widely accessible computing environments that would have astounded Bush still seem to require all manner of additional processes and steps to track content and share knowledge. At the same time, the web has created a world of seemingly infinite links and outward-bound content that has spanned global networks and lived at the edge of the desktop for more than a decade. This session looks at whether using an XML publishing framework helps address the obstacles posed by ""the artificiality of systems of indexing"" identified by Bush, and whether recent efforts to standardize XML pipeline processing procedures can possibly provide a meeting point between disparate technologies and insular content creation tools.

","Missing from years of digital library innovation is a simple, pragmatic approach for tying together everything we do. Breakthrough standards and technology remain mired in silos of content, integrated only within the small niche of software and services libraries provide. At the same time, the software development community continues to lower integration costs with techniques which offer ever-more-usable user services around information-rich content.

What if all of our digital library services and collections could be shared in a way that similarly lowered barriers to information integration? Can we provide a standard ""dialtone"" which makes connecting digital libraries in new user services as easy as placing a phone call? What if this ""dialtone"" could dramatically lower the costs of innovation in our community?

We will consider these questions and demonstrate approaches to providing such dialtone using Service Registries (which provide machine-functional, service-level cataloging) and Autodiscovery (techniques for automatically finding machine-processable resources associated with a particular web page).",talk,,,,

2005,2005-10-19,2:00pm - 2:45pm,"Stan Ruecker (Universtiy of Alberta, Edmonton, AB)","Visual Arrangement of Content in Rich-Prospect Browsing Interfaces
","I define rich-prospect browsing interfaces as those where some meaningful representation of every item in a collection is combined with tools for manipulating the display. Often this manipulation is for the purposes of carrying out some portion of a research task. One of the ways in which collections vary is in terms of their internal structure. For instance, information about pills might be considered to be all at a similar level, and an appropriate representation could place images of pills on a Cartesian grid. On the other hand, documents about the American Civil War might break logically in half, representing the two sides of the conflict. Data in family trees might be seen as more complex, and perhaps best represented in designs that are not particularly tree-like. And so on. This presentation will examine a variety of prototype interfaces being developed by researchers at the University of Alberta to accommodate different kinds of collections.
