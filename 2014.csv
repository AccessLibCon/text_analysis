2014,2014-09-30,1:30pm – 2:30pm,Kim Martin (DH MakerBus),Opening Keynote: Grass/Roots: Notes on a Public Digital Humanities,"Kim Martin is entering the fourth (and final!) year of her PhD in Library and Information Science, with a focus on the information habits of digital historians. She is the project manager of a 5 year SSHRC funded grant titled Digging Digital Humanities, for which she has traveled around North America and Europe researching digital humanities centers, projects, people, and networks. In 2013, Kim and two friends purchased a 1991 school bus, which they have since converted into Ontario’s first mobile makerspace: the DH MakerBus. This past summer, the DH MakerBus team ran their first ever Eurekamp for kids aged 6-10. MakeU was a huge success, proving to Kim and several super-enthusiastic parents that it’s never too early to start a humanities based education.What started as a passion project quickly became an area of academic interest, and Kim now works to showcase the public benefits of humanities education in London and beyond. She is a co-lead on the Humanities Matters Bus Tour (coming Spring 2015) and is currently implementing a local chapter of 4Humanities at Western University.",keynote,,,,

Currently overseen by the COPPUL Digital Preservation Working Group (DPWG), the PLN has been fully operational for 5 years, following a two-year pilot in 2008/2009. While the capacity of the PLN has been sufficient up to now, as digital preservation activities ramp up across the consortium it is possible to foresee the demand for space growing rapidly and unequally among members, raising the question of how to equitably balance resourcing and use of the shared space. This session will cover the history and development of the PLN; new COPPUL-led projects streamlining the onboarding of PLN content, including Archive-It, Archivematica, LOCKSS-o-matic, and LOCKSSdm; and future directions to address the challenges of sustainability, equitable resourcing and space allocation across all participants in the PLN.",talk,,,,

","To mark International Open Data Day 2014, a team of librarians at the University of Ottawa organized a one-day, open data hackfest. In keeping with the theme of open, the organizers decided to make the event as open as possible – open to all skill levels, open to all ideas, open to all students, professors, staff, and members of the public. This presentation will cover some of the key outcomes from a tremendously productive day and will demonstrate how the hackfest’s success is impacting library services and in-house technology education.",lightning,,,,

Where do cities and libraries intersect? How can we support digital literacy, promote civic participation and leverage the knowledge found in our communities? We discuss two events that took place in Edmonton in 2014 as case studies for these issues: Edmonton Public Library’s Open Data Day and hackYEG, local hackathons that brought together the library, the city, local data enthusiasts and an international community of civic hackers. Drawing on the philosophy of participatory learning, we argue that providing open data as part of library services supports an increasingly popular and important method of accessing and utilizing knowledge for all types of libraries.",lightning,,,,

While a challenge to the traditional IT service model, this opportunity potentially benefits the Library greatly as it makes efforts to contextualize its place and role within the 21st academic environment. Following the announcement, the Library and UBC IT conducted a 5 month-long comprehensive assessment of the Library’s operational needs and the IT infrastructure and services required to support the Library. This presentation will provide insight into the assessment process led by an enterprise architect and business analyst. Topics to be covered include: defining the Library’s business operations and developing a rubric of capabilities, functions, and processes; creating and analyzing a detailed application infrastructure review of over 100 Library-supported applications; diagramming process and ecosystem maps to visualize complex data interactions and integrations; mapping applications to the rubric and generating data to inform the findings and recommendations of the assessment. While this presentation is mostly concerned with describing the assessment process, it will close with a review of some of the key findings and next steps.",talk,,,,

While still reliant on vendors for some aspects of library software, more and more libraries are turning to in-house development and open-source software to take back a measure of control over their data and their users’ experience. MacEwan University and University of Alberta Libraries are both taking advantage of these new options in software development to create discovery and access systems that are more flexible and more intuitive. While these libraries differ greatly in their focus, and in the needs and requirements of their users, their approach to discovery has evolved along a similar path, with similar outcomes. Do projects like those at MacEwan and U of A represent a fundamental shift in how libraries understand discovery, or more broadly, a shift in how they understand their relationship with software vendors? This presentation will examine the discovery projects at U of A and MacEwan, and probe some of the big-picture questions such projects raise.",talk,,,,

Ensuring that comprehensive information on licensing permissions is displayed to our users is an urgent task. This session will look at three different approaches at Western University, Queen’s University, and University of Toronto regarding the implementation of a licensing permissions workflow using Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Usage Rights database (OUR). We will give a quick introduction to OUR license database and talk about how the Scholars Portal deployed it out to schools.

Young (Montana State University, Bozeman, MT)",Linked Data is People: Using Linked Data to Reshape the Library Staff Directory,"One of our greatest library resources is library personnel. Most libraries have staff directory information published on the web, yet most of this data is trapped in local silos, PDFs, or unstructured HTML markup. With this in mind, the library informatics team at our academic library set a goal of remaking our people pages by connecting the local staff database to the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In pursuing linked data integration for library staff, we have realized two primary use cases: improving the search engine optimization (SEO) for people pages and creating research network graphs.In this presentation we will focus on the linked data workflows and ontology expressions developed around this project.
– Defining strengths and weaknesses of leading LOD vocabularies for person entities, such as schema.org, VIAF, FOAF, LCSH, and ORCiD
– Detailing and sharing the ontology and data structures used for expressing relationships among people and research topics
– Demonstrating SEO techniques and results for surfacing people within commercial search engines
– Visualizing research networks and people recommendations based on the graph data mode",talk,,,,

Linked open data endeavors finding solutions by integrating reliable data’s providers, such as libraries. This purpose is getting very important, particularly with the overflowing of a massive amount of data and the emergence of a current demand: seeking for trustworthiness data and reliable providers.

",Unlocking the Door,"To locate course reserves information at Harvard, students usually navigate several screens. For more than one course, they must repeat the process; there is no shortcut
Our centrally managed and highly functional reserves processing system works well for librarians, but the student-facing presentation was straight-jacketed by a SOAP interface accessible only through Harvard’s decade-old, home-grown LMS.
Our evidence-based project, Course Reserves Unleashed!, leverages Solr 4 and RESTful API techniques to release reserves data into the wild, Our work opens up the opportunity for schools to feed in their other reserves data, for repurposing on their own websites and LMS.

2014,2014-10-02,8:45am – 9:15am,Karen Coombs (WorldShare Platform),RDF and Discovery in the Real World(cat),"The new WorldCat Discovery API has the typical abilities you’d expect for building your own local discovery world: search access to WorldCat bibliographic and article data, facets, a variety of search indexes, and links to holdings. But data modeling is where we really started to geek out with the WorldCat Discovery API. When we looked to a semantic web model for bibliographic data, we ended up applying a schema.org model to the response data in our new WorldCat Discovery API. Web service clients will find data readymade for embedding RDFa properties in their HTML output, enabling major search engines to understand the data sitting behind your user interface.Developers familiar with RDF data and serializations may be skeptical that the academic background for semantic web serializations like RDF/XML would make a good candidate for a highly usable, modern API. So were we.We’ll provide an overview of working with RDF data in a real-world context, including the data modeling for bibliographic data, and how to produce usable data responses that dodge both the complexity of MARC and the simplicity of Dublin Core. We’ll discuss the recent developments around RDF data, specifically the work around JSON for Linked Data, or JSON-LD. Emphasis will be paid to the ways in which the JSON-LD API and the JSON-LD Framing specification allow us to work with raw RDF data and construct semantically rich data that is easily consumable using an object-oriented programming paradigm.",talk,,,,
