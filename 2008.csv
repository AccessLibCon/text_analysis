,,9:30am-10:15am,Dale Askey ,"David Binkley Lecture: We Love Open Source Software. No, You Can't Have Our Code","Open source software enjoys the rapt attention of libraries. In practice, however, most institutions are better at consuming than producing open source code. Issues that repeatedly arise include: redundancy (“we can build it better”); shyness (""my code isn't perfect""); competitiveness (""we have an edge we don't want to lose""); quirkiness (""our needs are so unique that we'll ignore any obvious standards""). . . among others. Using a wide range of open source (or not so open source) projects, from fragments of simple code to large collaborative projects, this talk will illustrate these issues and (hopefully) point to some ways to share better.","binkley, talk",,[presentation slides],,[audio],
,,10:45am-11:30am,Eric Lease Morgan (University Libraries of Notre Dame),My Library - A Digital Library Framework and Toolbox,"This presentation describes and illustrates the functionality of a set of object-oriented Perl modules called MyLibrary. Comprised of three parts (information resources, people, and facet/term combinations), MyLibrary provides an architecture for librarians and developers to create any number of digital library implementations including sets of database-driven subject pages, a traditional library catalog complete with circulation, a full-text index of ebooks and articles, OAI clients and servers, or personalized “my” pages. Unlike other frameworks, MyLibrary explicilty includes places for people in its architecture, and through the facet/term combinations attempts to create relationships between them and information resources.",talk,,,,[audio],[presentation handout]

,,1:00pm-1:45pm,"Walter Lewis (OurOntario) | Slavko Manojlovich (Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NF)","""Ask not what you can do for the portal...""","In 2008 the AlouetteCanada/OurOntario.ca search portal is being extended to offer web services to those whose data is present in the portal (and others who want to leverage it in other ways). These services currently support the OurOntario.ca toolkit discovery layers and are closely integrated into their workflows. The web services will have an API for querying the portal and well-known outputs for integration into local systems. Building on the digitization experiences at Memorial University, Cape Breton University and other Atlantic institutions, the session will also cover what you need to know to create high quality digital collections which will seamlessly be part of Alouette Canada’s vision for creating a national digital library.",talk,,,,[audio],
,,1:45pm-2:45pm,"Ken Varnum (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI)",Tag! You're It,"The University of Michigan libraries launched MTagger, a home-grown social bookmark tool, in spring 2008. It allows users to tag individual library web pages, catalog records, digital library images, or any other web page. Through the “collections” feature — metadata assigning each tagged item to one of the library’s physical or online collections — users can broaden or narrow their search for tags. We built the tool to enhance findability across our collections and to expose “hidden” collections to users who might not know they even existed. In this talk, learn about why we built this tool, how it works, how it’s being used, and where we’re going with it.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],
,,3:15pm-4:00pm,Jonathan Bengston (University of Toronto) | Sian Meikle (University of Toronto),"Come, and Take Choice of All My Library: Mass Digitization Examined","Mass digitization is underway at many libraries through international partnerships such as the Open Content Alliance, Microsoft Live Books and Google Books. How can you add some digitized content to your holdings, and how can you get your own library’s books digitized? What does it take technically, and what do you get? What are the implications for our print collections? Are we closer to a universal library? Explore the questions with three librarians involved in the Open Library project and the University of Toronto’s mass digitization program, which has digitized 100,000 books as of April 2008.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],
,,4:00pm-5:00pm,"Steve Toub (BiblioCommons) | Martha Whitehead (Queen's University, Kingston, ON)",User-Generated Content and Social Discovery in the Academic Library Catalogue: Findings from User Research,"Just because a library catalogue provides Web 2.0 features like tags and comments doesn’t mean students will use these features. One aspect of Queen’s University Library’s partnership with BiblioCommons is to better understand how user-generated content might be applied to the academic library catalogue. The presenters will share findings from user research on: what types of user-generated content (e.g., evaluative ratings of required reading materials, comments on checked out books, sharing bibliographies created for an assignment) seem most applicable to the academic library catalogue; where in the flow students would be most willing to contribute; and what incentives seem most likely to encourage contributions.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],

We’ll discuss why we chose Drupal, out-of-the box vs. custom built applications, must-have modules, theming issues, design and implementation scenarios, and more. Panel members are from academic and public libraries.",talk,,,,,

,,1:00pm-1:45pm,Karen Coombs (University of Houston),Mashing Up and Remixing the Library Website,"Libraries today are presented with the challenge creating a unified user experience out of systems which are traditionally highly separate silos. Often this is done by literally copying and inserting data and information from one system to another. In the case of the library website data is often copied from the library catalog, article databases or other sources. However, this method is neither efficient nor sustainable. As a result, the University of Houston Libraries has developed a home grown content management system based on the following principles of Web 2.0: Radical decentralization, Small pieces loosely joined, and Remixable content. This tool allows librarians to create web pages that are a mix of types content from various systems including events, finding aids, blogs, library catalog, and federated search. By using this tool, subject librarians can create highly specialized “virtual libraries” for their users in a particular subject area. Additionally, content from the library website and other systems can now be incorporated into external websites such as those for colleges and departments. This innovation has allow the library to better serve its users by presenting them accurate, up to date, and relevant information.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],

,2008-10-04,8:30am-9:30am,"Allan Bell (University of Waterloo) | Greg Sennema (Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON)",Moving Forward Together: A Consortial Discovery Layer,"The current state of the ILS market is forcing libraries to make some hard strategic decisions on their choices of software. While some libraries are opting for open source and non-traditional vendor software, the Tri University Group (TUG) of Libraries have implemented Primo, a front-end product of a traditional ILS software. This session will discuss the rationale behind choosing this particular software, how Primo was implemented in a consortial environment, and how TUG hopes to remain relevant to our users while also keeping our options open for other ILS developments.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],
,,9:30am-10:30am,Andrew Nagy (Villanova University),Next Generation Catalog: The Library OPAC Meets Web 2.0 with VuFind,"Contemporary libraries need state-of-the-art software to make their collections and services visible and attractive to Web users accustomed to the one stop-shopping aspects of Google and the customer-oriented features of commercial sites such as Amazon. VuFind, an open-source resource discovery portal developed for libraries by libraries, has?harnessed the power of contemporary Web search technology that enables users to query and browse the library’s resources in a simple yet sophisticated manner. This talk will attempt to paint the picture of what a Next Generation Catalog might look like and what features we would expect to have followed by an in depth demonstration the VuFind software.",talk,,[presentation slides],,[audio],
